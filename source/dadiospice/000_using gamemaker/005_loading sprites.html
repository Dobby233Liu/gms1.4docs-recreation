<h1 class="studio">Loading Sprites</h1>

<h2 class="studio">In this section of the manual you can learn
about sprites and how to create them with the <i>GameMaker:
Studio</i> sprite editor.</h2>

<p>Sprites are generally the visual representations of objects
within the game you are creating. As such, a sprite is either a
single image, drawn with any drawing program you like, or a set of
images that, when played one after another, looks like a looping
animation. For example, the following 10 images form a sprite for a
character who is waving his arms while skydiving.<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="../images/sprite.png"></p>

<p>And the actual finished animation would look like this when
placed in a game:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="../images/sprites_anim_1.gif"></p>

<p>That looks pretty good, eh? Most games need you to make sprites
like this for all the things in your game world, from enemies to
power-ups, from walls to menus, and when you start to make a game
you normally collect or create a set of nice sprites for the
objects you are going to use. A considerable number of useful
sprites can be found on websites such as <a href=
"http://opengameart.org/" target="_blank">Open Game Art</a>, which
can be used as "place holders" until you have enough confidence to
make your own or get together with an artist.<br>
<br>
To create a sprite, choose the item <b>Create Sprite</b> from the
<b>Resources</b> menu, or use the corresponding button on the
toolbar. Either will cause the following window to open:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="../images/form_sprite.png"><br>
<br>
As you can probably see, the top left of the window has a field for
the "Name" of the sprite. All sprites (and all other resources)
must have a name given to them so that you (and <i>GameMaker:
Studio</i>!) can identify them easily, although you should note
that the actual name itself is really just a variable which holds a
number that "points" to the resource, in this case a sprite. It's
best to give each sprite a descriptive name so that you can
identify at a glance whether a particular resource is a sprite or
an object or anything else, and many people do this by prefixing or
suffixing the resource with the letters "spr". For example, the
above sky diver sprite could be called <b>spr_SkyDiver</b> or
<b>SkyDiver_spr</b>. Even though this is not strictly required, you
are strongly advised to use only letters and digits and the
underscore symbol (_) in a name of a sprite (and any other
resource) and to let it start with a letter, not a number as this
will become very important once you start using code.<br>
<br>
To load a sprite, click on the button <b>Load Sprite</b>. A special
file dialog window opens in which you can choose the sprite you
want to import into <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="../images/sprite_dialog.png"><br>
<br>
The left part is a fairly standard file selector in which you can
navigate around your computer and select the sprite that you want
to import. On the right you have a preview of the sprite image you
select and some basic information about its size. Here you can also
indicate a couple of things that you'd like <i>GameMaker:
Studio</i> to do when you import the sprite, like make opaque
(remove any transparent parts), remove the background colour (if it
has one) making it transparent, or whether to smooth the edges of
the sprite (only if it is transparent), which can greatly improve
its appearance. When you have found the sprite you need and
selected the transparency options you like, press <b>Open</b> to
load the sprite into <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>.<br>
<br>
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> can load many different formats of graphic
files - with JPG, BMP, PNG and GIF being the most common bitmap
formats, although you can also import SWF vector sprites and JSON
skeletal animation sprites (made with <b>Spine</b>). There are a
couple of things that should be noted when loading the different
bitmap files:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When you load an animated gif, the different images of the
animation automatically form the sprite subimages.<br>
<br></li>

<li>When the file name ends with _stripXX, where XX a number, it is
considered to contain a strip of XX subimages next to each other,
and <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> will import it as such. For example,
an image file with the name <tt>ball_strip4.png</tt> is assumed to
contain 4 subimages and will be split up as such when loaded.<br>
<br></li>

<li>If you have a sprite strip image that you wish to load into
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> which does not have the above-mentioned
format, this must be done from the <a href=
"../001_advanced%20use/more%20about%20sprites/edit%20menus/file%20menu.html">
Sprite Editor File Menu</a>.<br>
<br></li>

<li>Although JPG images are supported, it is best to avoid using
this file type as, due to the compression used, the images are
generally of poorer quality than either PNG or BMP.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the sprite is loaded you are returned to the sprite
properties window where the first subimage is shown on the right of
the screen. When there are multiple subimages, you can cycle
through them using the arrow buttons that appear beside the part of
the window labelled "Show", and, should you make any changes to the
sprite, you can then save it again using the "Save" button.<br>
<br>

Studio</i>, as well as details on the SWF and JSON formats, you can
