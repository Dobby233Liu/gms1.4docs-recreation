<h1 class="studio">GameMaker: Studio Overview</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section explains some of the some of the
core concepts of how <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> works so you can
start making games as quick as possible.</h2>

<h3 class="studio">The Global idea</h3>

<p>Before delving into the possibilities of <i>GameMaker:
Studio</i> it is good to get a feeling for the idea behind the
program. Games created with <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> take place in
one or more <i>rooms</i>. Now, these Rooms are flat 2 dimensional
spaces but they can contain 3D-looking graphics as well depending
on how you use them. In these rooms you place <i>objects</i>, which
you can define within the program. Typical objects can be walls,
moving balls, the main player controlled character, enemies, and
anything else you can think of from games that you have played!
Some objects, like walls, just sit there and don’t do anything,
while other objects, like the main player controlled character,
will move around and react to the input received from the player
using keyboard, mouse, or joystick. For example, when the main
character meets an enemy he might die or he might fight the enemy
and score points. As you can see, objects are the most important
ingredients of games made with <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>, so let us
talk a bit more about them.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">An Overview of Objects and Rooms</h3>

<p>First of all, most objects, when placed as instances within a
room, need some image to make them visible on the screen. Such
images are called <i>sprites</i>. A sprite is often not a single
image but a set of images that are shown one after the other to
create an animation and in this way it can look like a character is
walking, or a ball is rotating, or an enemy is exploding, etc...
During the game, the sprite of a particular instance of any object
can be changed, so a character can look different when it walks to
the left or to the right, for example. You can create your own
sprites in <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> or load them from files and use
them "as is" or edit them yourself with the powerful <i>GameMaker:
Studio</i> sprite editor. Here is an example of how a typical
object looks: <img class="center" src=
"../images/form_object.png"><br>
<br>
For an object to actually <i>do</i> something, we need to give it
actions, but we also need to tell it when to complete these
actions. To do that we use <i>EVENTS</i>. An <i>EVENT</i> is a
special moment in which we can place certain <i>actions</i> and be
sure that those actions will only happen when that <i>EVENT</i> is
triggered. There are a large number of different events that can
take place and a large number of different actions that you can let
your objects take too. For example, there is a <i>Create Event</i>
that is performed only when the object gets created. Actually,
that's not quite true! Objects are <i>never</i> created, rather
they are used to create <b>instances</b>... An instance is a copy
of the base object, complete with all the same events and actions,
and it's these that are used in your games. Think of an object as
the blueprint, and the instance as a manifestation of that
blueprint. For example, to add motion to a ball object when we
create an instance of it in a room, we would add a motion action to
the create event of the object.<br>
<br>
Another example of an event is the <i>Collision Event</i>. This is
triggered when two instances of any objects collide in the game
room. In such a case you can make the instance stop or reverse
direction or any number of other actions, like play a sound effect
or add points to a score. Further events include the <i>Keyboard
Event</i> (for when the player presses a key), <i>Mouse Event</i>
to detect mouse buttons, and the <i>Draw Event</i> which is where
we can tell each instance of an object to draw whatever we want.
There are still more events for each object and these are covered
further along in the manual.<br>
<br>
Once you have defined your objects it is time to define the
<i>rooms</i> in which they will be placed. Rooms can be used for
levels in your game or to show information or even to hold a start
menu. There are actions to go from room to room so that you can
create button objects that, when pressed, will move the player from
one room of the game to another. It should also be noted that if
you do not have any rooms in your game then <i>GameMaker:
Studio</i> will not run your game. But how do you create a room?
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> has a complete editor for creating these
areas and in the editor you can add and change many aspects of how
the room will look and play. For example, you can add
<i>backgrounds</i> in that can be either a simple colour or an
actual image. Such background images can be created in
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> with its own editor, or you can load them
into the resources from files. Backgrounds can actually be made to
do a lot of things but for the time being, just consider it as
something that makes the rooms look nice. Next, you can place one
(or multiple!) instances of any objects you have created into the
room. For example, you want to have a large walled area in your
game, so you would define one wall object and then place multiple
instances of that object in your room to create large, complex
walled areas. The same can be done for enemy objects too! Just make
one enemy object, and then place multiple instances within your
room to get a whole level created from only a few base objects.
Here is an example of how the room editor typically looks:
<img class="center" src=
"../images/getting_started_room_image.png"><br>
<br>
Once you have completed the design of your rooms, you are ready to
run the game. The first room to be shown is always the first room
in the main list of rooms and it will be run at the start. Now the
instances you have placed will come to life because of the actions
defined in their object create events and they will start reacting
to each other due to actions placed in the object collision events.
They will also react to the player using the actions placed in any
keyboard or mouse events.<br>
<br>
That covers the two most important things in <i>GameMaker:
Studio</i>, but there are a few more! All together they are called
<b>resources</b> and <b>assets</b>, and in the main screen of
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> you can find them on the left-hand side in
a space called the <b>resource tree</b>. Here is a list of them and
you should know that they will all play a crucial role in creating
your game:<br>
<br></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Sprites</b></i>: images (often animated) that are used to
represent the objects<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Sounds</b></i>: can be used in games as either background
music or as sound effects<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Backgrounds</b></i>: still images used as background for
the rooms<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Paths</b></i>: these can be used to make instances move
along a pre-defined path<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Scripts</b></i>: a script is a piece of code to which you
give a name and use like a GML function<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Shaders</b></i>: a shader is a combination of two
"programs" written in a <i>shader language</i> to create graphical
effects<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Fonts</b></i>: to draw text in the game you can add fonts
of many different styles<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Time lines</b></i>: can be used to control the precise
moment in a game that things should happen<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Objects</b></i>: which are the building blocks on which
your game is built<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Rooms</b></i>: the space (levels) in which the objects
are placed<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Included Files</b></i>: files that your game will export
to the chosen target for use<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Extensions</b></i>: the extensions included with your
game to expand functionality<br>
<br></li>

<li><i><b>Constants</b></i>: a per-configuration list of the
constants that you define for your game<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<i><b>Note:</b> To help you get familiar with</i> GameMaker:
Studio, it is strongly recommended that you follow some of the
beginner tutorials that come bundled with the program. These can be
found from the <b>Tutorials</b> tab on the start-up splash screen,
and cover all basic functionality.<br>
