<h1 class="studio">Draw Actions</h1>

<h2 class="studio">The draw actions are actions which draw things
to the screen.</h2>

<p>The following actions are all related to the act of drawing
things to the screen. As such, most of them can only be used in the
draw event of an object, and even then they will not be performed
if the object has been flagged as invisible through code or through
the object properties "visible" setting being un-checked.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Drawing</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/drawself.png" align="left"> <b>Draw
Self</b><br>
When you add any type of action or code to the draw event of an
object, you are telling <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> that you are
taking over the draw event and that you will tell it what to draw
from now on. This means that any assigned sprite will no longer be
drawn unless you explicitly say so, which when you would use this
action. This simply draws the assigned sprite for the object with
any transforms that may have been set in previous events (like
scaling, blending or changes in alpha) at the current
sub-image.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/draw_sprite.png" align="left"> <b>Draw
Sprite</b><br>
This will draw a sprite somewhere in the room. You specify the
sprite, the position (either absolute or relative to the current
instance position) and the subimage of the sprite (The subimages
are numbered from 0 upwards). If you have an animated sprite and
you want it to draw the subimages as normal, use number -1. This
action will not draw the sprite transformed, even if you have
changed the image blend or scale.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/draw_background.png" align="left"> <b>Draw
Background</b><br>
This will draw a background resource somewhere within the room. You
indicate the background image, the position (absolute or relative)
and whether the image should be tiled all over the room or not.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/draw_text.png" align="left"> <b>Draw
Text</b><br>
With this action you can draw text anywhere in the room. You
specify the text and the position to draw, but please note that
there are certain conventions to follow when drawing text:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A <b>#</b> symbol in the text is interpreted as going to a new
line, so typing this - <i>Hello world!#Nice day</i> - would draw
the text over two lines.</li>

<li>If you need to draw the # symbol itself, use \# ie - <i>this is
foobar \#3.</i></li>

<li>You can mix text and expressions to draw values of variables.
The text you want to draw must be in quotes (either ' or ") and the
variable to draw must use the <tt>string()</tt> function. For
example, if you wish to draw the value of the in-built object
variable <tt>direction</tt>, you would have this - <i>'Current
Direction = ' + string(direction)</i></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../../images/draw_text_scaled.png" align="left">
<b>Draw Scaled Text</b><br>
This action is similar to the previous action but this time you can
also specify a horizontal and vertical scaling factor to change the
size of the text and you can also specify an angle to rotate
it.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/draw_rectangle.png" align="left"> <b>Draw
Rectangle</b><br>
You specify the coordinates of the two opposite corners of the
rectangle, either absolute or relative to the current instance
position, and you can tell <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> to draw either
a solid filled rectangle, or just the outline. The colour of the
rectangle depends on the currently selected draw colour (see the
<b>Set colour</b> action below).<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/draw_gradient_hor.png" align="left">
<b>Horizontal Gradient</b><br>
This action also draws a rectangle but this time using a colour
gradient that changes from left to right. You can specify the size
and position of the rectangle, either absolute or relative to the
current instance position, and the two colours to use in the
gradient.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/draw_gradient_vert.png" align="left">
<b>Vertical Gradient</b><br>
This action also draws a rectangle but this time using a colour
gradient that changes from top to bottom. You can specify the size
and position of the rectangle, either absolute or relative to the
current instance position, and the two colours to use in the
gradient.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/draw_ellipse.png" align="left"> <b>Draw
Ellipse</b><br>
With this action you can draw an ellipse. You specify the
coordinates of the two opposite corners of the rectangle that would
border the ellipse, either absolute or relative to the current
instance position, and you can tell <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> to
draw either a solid filled ellipse, or just the outline. The colour
of the ellipse depends on the currently selected draw colour (see
the <b>Set colour</b> action below).<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/draw_ellipse_gradient.png" align="left">
<b>Gradient Ellipse</b><br>
As above, you draw an ellipse, but this time you can select a
gradient of two colours to fill it from the center out to the
border.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/draw_line.png" align="left"> <b>Draw
Line</b><br>
This simply draws a line between the two points that you specify in
the action, either absolute or relative to the current instance
position. The colour of the line depends on the currently selected
draw colour (see the <b>Set colour</b> action below).<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/draw_arrow.png" align="left"> <b>Draw
Arrow</b><br>
With this action you can draw a simple arrow. Much like the <b>Draw
Line</b> action, you specify the coordinates of the two endpoints
of the arrow, either absolute or relative to the current instance
position, and the size of the arrow tip. The size is in pixels and
is measured backwards from the end of the line, so that the point
of the arrow adds nothing to the overall length. The colour of the
line depends on the currently selected draw colour (see the <b>Set
colour</b> action below).<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Settings</h3>

<p>The following actions do <i>not</i> need to be called from the
draw event, and are usually only called once in a specific event
(like the <b>create event</b> or a <b>mouse event</b>) due to the
fact that they only need to set their action once in a game.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/set_colour.png" align="left"> <b>Set
colour</b><br>
Lets you set the colour used for drawing shapes, lines, and text.
This does not influence in any way sprites and backgrounds are
drawn.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/set_font.png" align="left"> <b>Set
Font</b><br>
You can set the font that is from this moment on used for drawing
text, but this must be one of the font resources you have defined
previously in the resource tree. If you choose No Font a default 12
point Arial font is used.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/fullscreen.png" align="left"> <b>Set Full
Screen</b><br>
With this action you can change the screen mode from windowed to
fullscreen and back. You can indicate whether to toggle the mode or
whether to go to windowed or fullscreen mode, making it an ideal
action for use in any kind of options menu for your game.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Other</h3>

<p>The following actions do <i>not</i> need to be called from the
draw event.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/snapshot.png" align="left"> <b>Take
Snapshot</b><br>
With this action you can take a snapshot image of the game while it
is being played and store it in a .png file, the name of which you
specify in the action.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images/explosion.png" align="left"> <b>Create
Effect</b><br>
With this action you can create all sorts of basic effects in a
very simple way. You specify the type of effect, e.g. an explosion
or smoke, its position, its size and its colour and whether it
should be shown below the objects (at a depth of 100000) or on top
of them (at a depth of -100000). The rest is done automatically for
you by the in-built <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> particle system (for
more information on particles see - <a href=
"005_extra%20actions.html">Extra Actions</a> and <a href=
"../../002_reference/particles/index.html">Reference:
Particles</a>). Note that for rain and snow the position is
irrelevant as it always falls down from the top of the screen and
that to get continuous rain you should create it in each step.<br>
