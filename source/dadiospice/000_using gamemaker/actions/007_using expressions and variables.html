<h1 class="studio">Using Expressions And Variables In Actions</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section covers how to use expressions and
the in-built instance variables in actions.</h2>

<p>When using many of the actions in <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> you
are expected to input a value as one of the parameters, but
sometimes that is not enough and you may find it necessary to input
a formula or an expression to get the required result from the
action. this is perfectly valid and <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>
permits the use of any of the in-built instance variables,
constants or global variables as well as the use of your own
(previously defined) variables and even mathematical formula! The
image below shows how this can work: <img class="center" src=
"../../images/action_expression.png"> As mentioned before,
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> also has a great number of in-built
variables that are unique to each and every instance created in a
room. These instance variables are created for you automatically
when you create an object and can be used, set and changed just as
you would any other variable. Below is a list of all these
variables:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/movement%20and%20collisions/movement/x.html"><b>
x</b></a>: the x-coordinate of the instance in the room. Changing
this will position the instance elsewhere in the room along the
x-axis.<br>
<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/movement%20and%20collisions/movement/y.html"><b>
y</b></a>: the y-coordinate of the instance in the room. Changing
this will position the instance elsewhere in the room along the
y-axis.<br>
<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/movement%20and%20collisions/movement/hspeed.html">
<b>hspeed</b></a>: the horizontal speed (in pixels per step) at
which the instance is moving. A positive value means movement to
the right and a negative value means movement to the left.<br>
<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/movement%20and%20collisions/movement/vspeed.html">
<b>vspeed</b></a>: the vertical speed (in pixels per step) at which
the instance is moving. A positive value means movement to the
bottom and a negative value means movement to the top.<br>
<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/movement%20and%20collisions/movement/direction.html">
<b>direction</b></a>: the current direction of motion in degrees
(0-360), where 0° is right, 90° is up, 180° is left and 270° is
down.<br>
<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/movement%20and%20collisions/movement/speed.html">
<b>speed</b></a>: the current speed of motion in the current
direction. For a "forward" motion (ie: facing the direction) this
is a positive value, and for a "backwards" motion it should be
negative.<br>
<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/objects%20and%20instances/instances/instance%20properties/visible.html">
<b>visible</b></a>: this is the flag that sets an object as being
visible (the draw event is performed) or invisible (the draw event
is skipped).<br>
<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/objects%20and%20instances/instances/instance%20properties/image_index.html">
<b>image_index</b></a>: this variable indicates which subimage in
the current sprite is currently shown. When the animation speed
(image_speed, see below) is set to a value greater than 0, this
variable changes each step to reflect the sub-image being shown of
the animation .<br>
<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/objects%20and%20instances/instances/instance%20properties/image_speed.html">
<b>image_speed</b></a> this variable indicates the speed with which
the subimages are shown, with the default value being 1 (meaning 1
frame per step). If you make this value larger than 1 some
subimages are skipped to make the animation faster, and conversely,
if you make it lower than 1, then some sub-images are repeated over
various steps to make it animate slower.<br>
<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/objects%20and%20instances/instances/instance%20properties/id.html">
<b>id</b></a>: the unique identifier (an integer) of the instance.
This value is assigned to the instance when it is created and
cannot be changed.<br>
<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/objects%20and%20instances/instances/instance%20properties/object_index.html">
<b>object_index</b></a>: this is the <i>index</i> (not the name) of
the object that the instance has been created from. This value is
assigned to the instance when it is created and cannot be
changed.<br></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Further information on in-built <i>instance</i> variables can be
found in the following sections:<br>

<p>Apart from the in-built instance variables, we also have a
number of <i>global</i> variables that can be used in actions too
(see <a href=
"../../002_reference/001_gml%20language%20overview/variables/index.html">
Variables And Variable Scope</a> for more information on global
variables). Here are a few of those available:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/001_gml%20language%20overview/variables/score.html">
<b>score</b></a>: the current value of the score<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/001_gml%20language%20overview/variables/lives.html">
<b>lives</b></a>: the current number of lives<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/001_gml%20language%20overview/variables/health.html">
<b>health</b></a>: the current health (0-100)<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/mouse,%20keyboard%20and%20other%20controls/mouse%20input/mouse_x.html">
<b>mouse_x</b></a>: x-position of the mouse<br></li>

<li><a href=
"../../002_reference/mouse,%20keyboard%20and%20other%20controls/mouse%20input/mouse_y.html">
<b>mouse_y</b></a>: y-position of the mouse<br></li>
</ol>
