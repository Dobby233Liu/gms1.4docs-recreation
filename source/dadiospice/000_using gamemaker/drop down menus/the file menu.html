<h1 class="studio">The File Menu</h1>

<h2 class="studio">Here you can find out all about the various
options available to you from the drop down file menu.</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="file_menu_image.png"><br>
<br>
In the file menu you can find the commands you'd expect for loading
and saving files, but there are also a few special ones:<br>
<br></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>New:</b> Choose this command to start creating a new game
from scratch. If the current game has changed you are asked whether
you want to save it before proceeding. There is also a tool-bar
button for this command, but both will methods will take you back
to the "Welcome" screen where you can create a new project.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Open:</b> Opens a <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> game file with
the extension <b>*.gmx</b>.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Import:</b> Imports a <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> <b>*.gmz</b>
compressed file (which will then be saved as a standard
<b>*.gmx</b>) game file. You can also select to import Legacy
GameMaker files with the extensions <tt>gm81</tt>, <tt>gmk</tt>,
<tt>gm6</tt> or <tt>gb1...n</tt> files from here. <i>These might
not work correctly in this new version due to changes in GameMaker
over the years</i>, and as such it is recommended that you check
out the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/24909988"
target="_blank">YoYo Knowledge Base</a> to see what's changed
between versions before deciding to import legacy files. There is
also a tool-bar button for this command and you can even open a
game by dragging the file into the actual <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>
window.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Recent Files:</b> Use this sub-menu to open game files you
have recently opened or modified.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Save:</b> Saves the game project file under its current name
with the <b>*.gmx</b> extension. If no name was specified before,
you are asked for a new name. You can only use this command when
the file has been changed and, again, there is a tool-bar button
for this. Saving with this command will only save those things that
have been changed since the file was opened.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Save As:</b> Saves the current game project file under a
different name. You are asked for a new name before saving.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Save All:</b> Saves the game project file under its current
name with the <b>*.gmx</b> extension. If no name was specified
before, you are asked for a new name. Unlike the regular
"<b>Save</b>" command, this will export and save <i>all</i> the
game information, whether it has changed or not.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Export Project:</b> Exports your project as a <i>compressed
GameMaker file</i> with the format <b>*.gmz</b>. These project
files contain <b>all</b> the information relevant to your current
project (including resources, extensions, game information etc...)
which can then be imported again into <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> as a
complete project in the future. This is very useful for
transferring a project over a network as well as for storing
shelved projects or backup copies of a current project.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Create Application:</b> Once your game is ready you will
probably want to give it to others to play! By using this command
you create a stand-alone version of your game. The actual files
produced will depend on the target module chosen in the drop down
menu of the <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> GUI.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Preferences:</b> This will open the <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>
preferences where you can adjust how the program looks as well as
different behaviours when dealing with resources etc... For further
information on this please see <a href=
"../../001_advanced%20use/preferences/index.html"><i>GameMaker:
Studio</i> Preferences</a><br></li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Exit:</b> We know that making games is fun and addictive,
but you need to eat and sleep sometimes! So press this to exit
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i>. If you changed the current game project
then you will be asked whether you want to save it before the
program closes.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>
</ul>
