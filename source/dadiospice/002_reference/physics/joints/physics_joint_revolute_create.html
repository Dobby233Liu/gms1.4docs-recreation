<h3 class="studio">Description</h3>

<p>A revolute joint forces two bodies to share a common anchor
point (often called a hinge point) and the joint has a single
degree of freedom - the relative rotation of the two bodies around
this point. To specify a revolute you need to provide two instances
and a single anchor point in the room, as you can see in the image
provided:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="revolute_joint_image_1.png"></p>

<p>If you look at the image, you can see that the two instances
have been created to over-lap and at the point where they are
touching, we have defined a revolute joint. Now, this joint can be
limited in its freedom of rotation thanks to the "ang_min_limit"
and "ang_max_limit" values. How does this work? Well, let's look at
another image:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="revolute_joint_image_2.png"></p>

<p>As you can see, angles in the physics world are <i>not</i> the
same as the standard <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> angles where right is
0 degrees and then it goes anti-clockwise so that up is 90, left is
180, and down is 270. No, when dealing with the revolute joint, the
0 degrees axis runs from the joint position to the origin of the
second instance defined by the function and the angles are then
calculated in a clockwise direction. If you switch on angle
limiting, the limits are defined as being relative to this 0 degree
axis and the limit range <i>should include zero</i>, otherwise the
joint will lurch when the room begins. Finally, you can define the
joint as having a motor or not. This means that when uninfluenced
by a collision the joint will move in a direction, which is defined
by the motor speed with a positive number being clockwise and a
negative number being anti-clockwise. The "max_motor_torque"
argument is for limiting the speed of the rotation so that you
don't get a perpetually accelerating motor and to limit the
influence that a collision may have on the rotation. In this way
you can use a joint motor to simulate joint friction by setting
joint speed to zero and maximum torque to some small, but
significant value. The motor will try to prevent the joint from
rotating, but will yield to a significant load.<br>
<br>
As with all the joints, if you set the "col" value to <tt>true</tt>
then the two instances can interact and collide with each other but
<i>only</i> if they have collision events, however if it is set to
<tt>false</tt>, they will not collide no matter what.<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Example:</h3>

<p class="code">var mainFixture, o_id;<br>
mainFixture = physics_fixture_create();<br>
physics_fixture_set_circle_shape(mainFixture,
sprite_get_width(sprite_index) / 2);<br>
o_id=instance_create(x+25, y, obj_Door);<br>
physics_fixture_bind(mainFixture, id);<br>
physics_fixture_bind(mainFixture, o_id);<br>
physics_joint_revolute_create(id, o_id, x+25, y, -90, 90, 1, 0, 0,
0, 0);<br>
physics_fixture_delete(mainFixture);<br></p>

<p>The above code creates and defines a new fixture and then
creates an instance of "obj_Door", binding the created fixture to
the two new objects. They are then joined by a revolute joint with
no motor and the angles limited to a +/- 90 degree swing. Finally
the fixture is deleted as it is no longer needed.</p>
