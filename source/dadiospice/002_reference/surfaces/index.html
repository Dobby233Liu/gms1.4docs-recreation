<h1 class="studio">Surfaces</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section deals with the functions related to
creating and manipulating surfaces.</h2>

<p>In the normal draw events, GameMaker: Studio doesn't actually
draw directly to the screen, but rather draws to a <b>surface</b>
called the <i>application surface</i>. This surface is basically a
blank "canvas" that can then later be manipulated before being
drawn to the screen when needed, and in most cases GameMaker:
Studio handles this for you (although you can also manipulate it
yourself in code for shaders, scaling and many other things -
further details are given below).<br>
<br>
However, apart from this application surface, you can also create
your own surfaces and use them to create stunning or subtle special
effects in your game. For example, you can use surfaces to "catch"
instances, which can then be destroyed, and in this way you can
create a decal effect where the sprite for the instance is
displayed on the surface as if it still existed, permitting
graphical effects like debris, blood, etc... without any real
processing overhead. Another thing you can do with surfaces is use
them as textures to be manipulated, or to create sprites "on the
fly", or to create complex overlays. in fact, the uses for surfaces
are endless!<br>
<br>
Normal surfaces are quite easy to use, but there are a few basic
rules to be followed when you use them:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>First, you should realise that surfaces (<i>except</i> the
application surface) are "volatile". This means that if the device
or window loses focus or is minimised (good examples are when a
screensaver comes up in Windows, or on an Android device when the
app loses focus due to a call) then the surface may be destroyed.
This is because it is stored in the texture memory and may be
overwritten when the target platform needs that memory for
something else which means that you should <i><b>always</b></i>
have some type of fail-safe code in place, usually with the
<a href="surface_exists.html"><tt>surface_exists</tt></a>
function.<br>
<br></li>

<li>Second, you should note that surfaces require large quantities
of texture memory to be used, and so you should attempt to keep
them as small as possible. Normally you would try and keep them no
larger than the size of the view or display window.<br>
<br></li>

<li>Third, you should try to draw to surfaces in the draw event.
This is not always possible, but due to the optimised way in which
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> draws to the screen, it is recommended
that you keep all draw functions <i>within the draw event</i>.<br>
<br></li>

<li>Fourth, when drawing to a surface manually, the surface is
<i>always</i> at the position of (0,0). This means that you may
need to convert absolute coordinates into local coordinates for the
surface. For example, if you have a view-sized surface and wish to
draw something that is currently in view to that surface, you
should subtract the view x and y coordinates from the actual x and
y coordinates to get a relative position to the surface (0,0)
position. So, the code would look something like this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">if view_current = 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surface_set_target(surf);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with (obj_Effect)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw_sprite(sprite_index,
image_index, x - view_xview[1], y - view_yview[1]);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surface_reset_target();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw_surface(surf, 0, 0);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br></p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The basic use of a surface would be as follows - You first
create a surface and assign its index to a variable. You would then
set the drawing target to the surface rather than the display and
draw the things you wish as well as perform any other
manipulations. Once you are done you reset the drawing target so
that all further drawing happens on the screen again. One thing to
note is that should you require drawing the whole display to a
surface (including tiles, backgrounds etc...) you can simply access
the application surface itself (see below for further details) or
you could assign a surface to a view using the variable <a href=
"../windows%20and%20views/views/view_surface_id.html"><tt>view_surface_id[0..7]</tt></a>as
with this all that is visible in that view will be drawn to the
corresponding surface.<br>
<br>
The following functions exist to deal with surfaces:</p>

<p>These functions are specific for creating and manipulating
surfaces, but to actually draw them to the screen you should be
using the specific draw functions that can be found in the section
on <a href="../drawing/drawing%20surfaces/index.html">Drawing
Surfaces</a>.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">The Application Surface</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, all normal drawing in your game is done on
the <i>application surface</i>, and this surface can be changed and
manipulated just like a normal surface. However, it is <i>not</i> a
normal surface and advanced users will find that it enables
complete control over how and when things are drawn in
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i>. For more details, as well as specific
functions for this feature, please see the following section:</p>
