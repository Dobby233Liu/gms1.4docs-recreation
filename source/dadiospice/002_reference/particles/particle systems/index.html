<h1 class="studio">Particle Systems</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section deals with setting up, maintaining
and destroying particle systems.</h2>

<p>Before you can create particles you need to create a particle
system. This is a "container" where you place your particles and
emitters (if you need them) ready for use, and you can put as many
or as few particles into any one system as you think necessary, and
you can have as many systems as you think necessary too. However,
it is always better to keep this number as small as possible due to
the fact that each system, emitter and particle takes up memory and
having too many of them may slow your game down or cause problems.
For example, if you need some effects to appear above instances,
and other effects to appear beneath instances, you would create two
systems and set their depths to get the desired effect, with all
particles that are added to each system being drawn at the depth
you specify.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">System Functions</h3>

<p>Since a particle system is a dynamically created resource, you
must create it and store the returned index in a variable to
reference the system in all further function calls, and it is very
important that you also destroy the system when it is no longer
needed or else you will have a memory leak that will slow down and
eventually crash your game. It is also worth noting that particle
systems will live on forever after they are created, even if the
index is no longer stored. So even if you change room or restart
the game, the systems and the particles will remain, and be
visible, in all further rooms so you better make sure you destroy
them once you no longer need them.<br>
<br>
The basic functions for setting up a particle system are listed
below:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href="part_system_exists.html">part_system_exists<br></a>
</li>

</li>

<li><a href=
"part_particles_count.html">part_particles_count<br></a>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="studio">Particle System Drawing</h3>

<p>Once particles are added to a particle system and then burst or
streamed into the room, they are normally automatically updated
each step and drawn based on the parameters that you have used to
define them. However it can sometimes be necessary to control when
and how the system is updated as well as how the system should be
drawn, and for that <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> provides the following
functions:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href=
"part_system_automatic_update.html">part_system_automatic_update<br>
</a>
</li>

<li><a href=
"part_system_automatic_draw.html">part_system_automatic_draw<br></a>
</li>

<li><a href="part_system_update.html">part_system_update<br></a>
</li>

<li><a href="part_system_drawit.html">part_system_drawit<br></a>
</li>

<li><a href=
"part_system_draw_order.html">part_system_draw_order<br></a>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="studio">Creating Particles Directly</h3>

<p>Normally you would use <a href=
"../particle%20emitters/index.html">particle emitters</a> to burst
or stream particles from an area, but in many cases these are not
necessary and it is actually better to just create the particles
directly using the following functions:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href=
"part_particles_create.html">part_particles_create<br></a>
</li>

<li><a href=
"part_particles_create_colour.html">part_particles_create_colour<br>
</a>
</li>
</ol>
