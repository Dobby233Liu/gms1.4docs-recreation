<h1 class="studio">Particles</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section deals with the use of particles to
create cheap graphic effects.</h2>

<p>For complex things in <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> you would
normally have an <a href=
"../objects%20and%20instances/objects/index.html">object</a> and
create <a href=
"../objects%20and%20instances/objects/index.html">instances</a> of
that object around the room. However, for graphics effects, this
can be expensive as every instance comes with a "cost" in
processing due to the variables it contains and the codes it has in
the different events. You can reduce this cost by turning to
<a href=
"../game%20assets/backgrounds/background%20tiles/index.html">tiles</a>
for drawing your graphics needs but those are generally static and
cannot easily be changed or moved. However, there is one other
option for drawing fast yet versatile graphics effects in your
games, and that is to use <i>particles</i>.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">What are particles?</h3>

<p>Particles are graphic resources that have certain properties
which are defined within a <i>particle system</i>. These properties
cannot be manipulated directly for individual particles, but are
changed through the code that is used to define the individual
particle and the system that it belongs to. They are very useful
for creating beautiful and flashy effects (or subtle and discreet
ones!) like explosions, decals, rain, snow, star fields and debris
in a game without the CPU overhead that using instances has.<br>
<br>
The basic setup for a particle system follows three steps, with the
third step being optional depending on how you wish to create your
particle effects within the room:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Create a particle system</b>: The particle system is like a
container that we will use to hold our different particle types
ready for use. We use code to define a series of visual aspects and
behaviours for our particles, and then we place them in the
"container" so that we can take them out and use them whenever and
wherever we need later.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Create particle types</b>: Particle types are the graphic
effect itself. You can have many different types, each with their
own range of colours, alphas, sizes and movements, but its
important to note that you <i>do not have control over individual
particles</i>. You define a series of parameters and the particle
will be created to have a random spread of behaviours chosen from
them.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Create emitters</b>: Emitters are an option that can be used
to burst or stream particles from within very clearly defined
limits. They are optional because you can create particles from any
instance using the <a href=
"particle%20systems/part_particles_create.html"><tt>part_particles_create</tt></a>
and <a href=
"particle%20systems/part_particles_create_colour.html"><tt>part_particles_create_colour</tt></a>
functions but they are not always adequate for every
situation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="studio">Limitations</h3>

<p>Although particles are an excellent tool for creating effects,
they do come with certain restrictions and good practices which
need to be followed unless you want your game to grind to halt and
eventually crash:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Particle systems, particles and emitters take up memory and as
such you should be very careful how you use them as it is very easy
to cause a memory leak which will slow down and eventually crash
your game. One way to cope with this is to have a <i>global</i>
system with everything defined at the start of the game and removed
at the end, but if you want a dynamic system then each particle and
emitter (and the system itself) should be destroyed the moment it
is not needed.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>Particles may be fast and light on the CPU, but they still
require <i>some</i> processing and so you shouldn't have 40,000 of
them bursting across the screen at a time. Limit them to those that
are necessary to achieve a specific effect and no more.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>If you define your own particle sprite instead of using one of
the 14 included sprites, you should try to keep them as small as
possible to achieve the effect you require.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>Particles do <i>not</i> interact with anything. Should you need
them to have any type of interaction with the user or any other
instances in your game, you should be looking at using instances
instead as particles are purely graphic.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>Even though there is no technical limit to the amount of
systems, emitters and particles you can create in one game, you
should try and limit everything to the minimum number possible to
keep memory use as low as possible.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>On mobile devices, take care with particles as <i>drawing</i>
them can be slow if they cover a large area of the screen
(over-draw on mobile devices is one of the main causes of
slowdown).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>With HTML5 there is no additive blending, and unless you have
WebGL enabled, you cannot have colour blending either.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>
</ul>
