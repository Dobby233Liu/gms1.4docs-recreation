<h1 class="studio">Addressing Variables in Other Instances</h1>

<h2 class="studio">Here you can find various methods for addressing
variables in other Instances.</h2>

<p>In the sections dedicated to <a href=
"variables/index.html">variables</a> you found out how to create
and create and use variables within a single instance, or on a
global scope, but what happens if you want to one instance to
access a variable in another, different one? There are many cases
when you may want to do this, for example in a collision with a
bullet object, you may want to find out how much damage the bullet
does by accessing a variable in the bullet, or you might want to
stop the motion of all the balls in a puzzle , or you might want to
move the main character to a particular position, or any number of
other situations you typically come across in any game. Thankfully
the GameMaker Language comes equipped with mechanisms to achieve
this.<br>
<br>
One of the most common methods for accessing or changing a variable
in another instance is to use its object name as an identifier and
then use a point "." to tell <i>GameMaker</i> that the variable
used after is to be assigned or changed in that object. In practice
it would look like this:<br>
<br></p>

<p class="code">obj_ball.speed = 0;<br></p>

<p><br>
With the above code you are setting the speed of an instance of
"obj_ball". However if you have more than one instance of the given
object in the room, then it will apply to ALL of them equally -
unless you are using one of the <b>JS</b> targets or <b>HTML5</b>,
in which case it will affect only one, but you have no way of
knowing which one it will affect - so if you need to access all
instances of an object, you should be using <a href=
"401_18_with.html"><tt>with</tt></a>, as that is 100% cross
platform compatible. In general, this format should only be used
when you have a single instance of the object in the room, or (as
you will see in the next part) when you have a specific instance
ID.<br>
<br>
You can also access a single instance of an object when there are
multiple instances within the room using the <b>instance id</b> to
tell <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> exactly which instance we wish to
address. The <b>instance id</b> is the unique identifying number
that is given to each and every instance created in your game. When
you put instances in a room in the room editor, this instance id is
shown at the bottom of the screen when you hover the mouse cursor
over the instance, but even if you create an instance through code
it still has its unique id number. These numbers are always larger
than or equal to 100000, and such a number can also be used as the
left-hand side of the point.</p>

<blockquote><i><b>Note:</b> The dot will get interpreted as the
decimal point in a real number normally, so, to avoid this, put
brackets around it!</i>
</blockquote>

<p>The following code is an example of how this should be
written:<br>
<br></p>

<p class="code">(100012).speed = 0;<br></p>

<p><br>
Note that you cannot use the special <a href=
"keywords.html">keyword</a> "<tt>all</tt>" with this method to
target all instances, but you can use the keywords "<tt>other</tt>"
and "<tt>self</tt>" without issues. You can also use variables, as
long as the variable in question has stored a valid <b>instance
id</b>. The following examples illustrate this...<br>
<br>
Using a variable to set an instance value:<br>
<br></p>

<p class="code">var inst = instance_position(mouse_x, mouse_y,
all);<br>
if instance_exists(inst) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inst.speed = 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br></p>

<p><br>
Note that the above code has an <tt>instance_exists()</tt> call in
the code block. This is because using the point method to access or
change another instances value will give an error and crash the
game if the instance does not exist. Therefore if there is the
possibility that the instance could be destroyed, deactivated, or
otherwise removed from the room while using this method, you should
<i>always</i> check before hand using the
<tt>instance_exists()</tt> function or the
<tt>instance_number()</tt> function.<br>
<br>
These are all perfectly valid ways of reading, changing and setting
variables in other instances, and work because the point is
actually an <i>operator</i>. It takes a value as left operand and a
variable (address) as the right operand, and returns the address of
this particular variable in the indicated object or instance. All
the object names, constants, IDs etc... simply represent values and
these can be dealt with like any other value.<br>
