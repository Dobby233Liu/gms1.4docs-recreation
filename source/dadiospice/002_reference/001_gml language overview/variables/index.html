<h1 class="studio">Variables And Variable Scope</h1>

<h2 class="studio">Here you can learn about the different types of
variables in <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>.</h2>

<p>Like any programming language GML uses variables as the basic
unit for most programming operations. Variables are used to store
information in the devices memory for later (or instant) use, and
they are given a name so that you can refer to them in functions
and programs. A variable in GML can store either a real number
(like 100, 2.456575, -56 etc...) or a string (like "Hello
world!").<br>
<br>
A variable is something that we use to store a value for use in one
or more operations or functions. Think of "pi", for example... it
is a real world variable that holds the value 3.14159265(etc...).
Why? Well, it's much easier to say to someone "pi" than "three
point one four one five nine two six five"! So, naming things make
life a lot simpler and it also means that should the value of that
variable ever change, we don't have to change the number everywhere
as the variable <i>name</i> is still the same. In <b>GML</b> a
variable has a name that must start with a letter and can contain
only letters, numbers, and the underscore symbol '_' with a maximum
length of 64 symbols. So, valid variables are things like
<tt>fish</tt>, <tt>foo_bar</tt>, <tt>num1</tt>, and invalid
variables would be <tt>6fish</tt>, <tt>foo bar</tt>, or
<tt>*num</tt>. Now, In many programing languages you need to
"declare" a variable before you can use it. This basically means
that you tell the computer the name you wish to use so that it can
assign a place in memory to store whatever value you decide to hold
in that variable. With <b>GML</b>, that is not always necessary as
it depends on the <i>scope</i> of the variable. There are four main
variable categories when you program with <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>
and each has its own <i>scope</i> (which is can be considered as
its area of operation, or reach). These variables and their scope
are outlined below:<br>
<br></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>instance</b>: these are the most common variables and are
defined within an instance. These are unique to that instance and
can be used in any event and any function within that instance.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>local</b>: these variables must be declared using the "var"
function. A local variable is only valid for the event or script
resource in which it is created. So <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> will
create the variable, use it for the duration of the event and then
"forget" it again, meaning that if you try to use it later you will
get an "unknown variable" error.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>global</b>: a global variable is one that belongs to the
game world itself and not to any one instance. It has to be
declared as global first, but after that any instance can check or
change the variable and the value will always reflect the last
operation done on it, no matter what instance or code box has
performed the operation.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>built in variables</b>: these are special variables that are
"built into" the objects and the rooms in the game world and they
can be instance only or global in scope (but <i>never</i> local)
.<br></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>More details can be found for these variable types on the
following pages:<br>

<p>There are a few functions designed to help you when dealing with
instance variables and global variables, although these are
generally more associated with debugging than anything else:</p>
