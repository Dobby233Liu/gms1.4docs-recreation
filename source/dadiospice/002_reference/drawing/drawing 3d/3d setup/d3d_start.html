<h2 class="studio">Tells <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> that all further
drawing is to be done in 3D mode.</h2>

<h3 class="studio">Syntax:</h3>

<p class="code">d3d_start()</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p><b>Returns:</b> Real</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h3 class="studio">Description</h3>

<p>With this function you can tell <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> that
all further drawing should be done in 3D mode. This function can be
called in any event, but will affect <i>all drawing</i> done after,
so if your game is not completely done in 3D you may need to switch
it off using <a href="d3d_end.html"><tt>d3d_end</tt></a> to draw
certain parts (and then use this function again to switch 3D mode
back on).<br>
<br>
Starting 3D mode will result in the following changes:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>First of all depth testing (also known as Z Buffering) is
switched on (using a 24-bit z-buffer). This means that for each
pixel on the screen only the drawing with the smallest z-value (=
depth value) is drawn. If instances have the same depth then you
will get what is known as Z-fighting. This occurs as the 2
instances attempt to draw at the same level, and inaccuracies in
the rendering due to very close Z value cause ugly effects. To
avoid this, try and make sure instances that might overlap do not
have the same depth value!</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>Secondly, the normal orthographic projection is replaced by a
perspective one. This means the following. Normally the size of
instances on the screen is independent on its depth. With a
perspective projection instances that have a greater depth will
appear smaller. When the depth is 0 it is equal to the old size
(unless you change the projection). The viewpoint for the camera is
placed at a distance above the room. (This distance is equal to the
width of the room; that gives a reasonable default projection.)
Only instances in front of the camera are drawn. So don't use
instances with a depth smaller than 0 (or at least not smaller than
-w where w is the width of the room or the view).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>Thirdly, the vertical y-coordinate is reversed. While normally
the (0,0) position is at the top-left of the view, in 3D mode the
(0,0) position is at the bottom-left position, as is normal for
3-dimensional views.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="studio">Example:</h3>

<p class="code">d3d_start();</p>

<p>This code has been placed in the create event of an instance to
tell <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> that all further drawing should be
done in 3D mode.</p>
