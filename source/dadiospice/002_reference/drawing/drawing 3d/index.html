<h1 class="studio">Working With 3D</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section details all the functions available
to you to create 3D games.</h2>

<p><i>GameMaker: Studio</i> is a primarily a program meant for
making 2D (2-dimensional) and isometric games but there is the
functionality to create 3D (3-dimensional) graphics and use 3D
effects if you wish. Before you start with this though there are a
few things you should understand:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The 3D functionality in GameMaker is limited to the graphics
part. There is no support for other 3D functionality. Once you
start using 3D graphics you might get problems with other aspects
of GameMaker if you are not used to working with 3D. Things like
views, depth ordering, etc... require you to have sound
understanding of how <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> works as well as how
to code 3D in general.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>When you use the 3D functionality, there are a number of other
things that can no longer be used:<br>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>You cannot use background and foregrounds in your rooms anymore
as they are tiled to fill the image but with perspective
projections this no longer work correctly.</li>

<li>You cannot use the mouse position as normal anymore either,
because the mouse coordinates will not be transformed into 3D
coordinates. You can, however, still get the position of the mouse
on the screen (in the view) but you will have to do positional
calculations yourself for 3D (or not use the mouse at all).</li>

<li>You should not use tiles anymore as most tiles will likely no
longer match up correctly. Collision checking still uses the 2-d
positions of the instances in the room, so there is no collision
detection in 3D. Sometimes you can still use this however, if you
use the room as a representation of a flat world (e.g. for racing
or FPS games) but in other situations you will have to do things
yourself.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote></li>

<li>All 3D functionality is through code, so you must have a sound
understanding of GML (the GameMaker language).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>You must have some basic knowledge about 3D graphics, in things
like perspective projections, hidden surface removal, lighting, and
fog as this manual will not give much explanation and takes for
granted that you are familiar with such terms.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><i><b>NOTE:</b> These functions do not work with the HTML5
module unless you have enabled WebGL in the <a href=
