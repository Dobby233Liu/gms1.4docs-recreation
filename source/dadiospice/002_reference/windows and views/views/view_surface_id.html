<h1 class="studio">view_surface_id</h1>

<h2 class="studio">Assign a surface to a view.</h2>

<h3 class="studio">Syntax:</h3>

<p class="code">view_surface_id[0...7]</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p><b>Returns:</b> Real</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h3 class="studio">Description</h3>

<p>With this variable you can set a given view to draw to a
surface, or get the current surface id if one has been assigned to
a view. When working with surfaces, it is often required that you
draw the <i>whole</i> visible region of the screen to the surface,
and so you would assign it to a view using this function. This
means that everything that is shown in the chosen view will now be
drawn to the assigned surface. The view will now <i>not</i> be
drawn to the screen, meaning that you will need to do either:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enable a new view and draw the surface only in that view (using
<a href="view_current.html"><tt>view_current</tt></a> to check
which view is being drawn)</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>Draw the surface in the Draw GUI event of an instance, since
the GUI layer is independent of views.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also read this variable to get the index of the surface
that has been assigned to the chosen view or it will return -1 if
no surface has been assigned, and generally the surface used for
this function should be the size of the view itself (not the view
port). The extended example below shows a basic setup for capturing
a view and drawing it in the <b>Draw GUI</b> event, and for more
information on surfaces see the section <a href=
"../../surfaces/index.html">Reference - Surfaces</a>.<br>
<br></p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h3 class="studio">Extended Example:</h3>

<p>In this extended example, we will create a surface and assign it
to view 0, then draw that to the screen in the Draw GUI event. To
start with we need to initialise our surface variable in the
<b>Create Event</b> of a controller instance:</p>

<p class="code">surf = -1;</p>

<p>We set the surface variable to -1, as all surface functions
should really be used in the <b>Draw</b> events to prevent odd
errors or undefined behaviours. So, with that done, we would then
have this in the main <b>Draw</b> event:</p>

<p class="code">if !surface_exists(surf)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surf = surface_create(view_wview[0],
view_hview[0]);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view_surface_id[0] = surf;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br></p>

<p>Surfaces are <i>volatile</i> meaning that they could be removed
from memory at any time due to OS memory management and other
things, so here we check to see if our surface exists and if it
doesn't we create it and assign it to the view 0. With that done,
everything that would appear in view 0 will now be drawn to the
surface we have created instead. If you do nothing else at this
point, when you run your game you will simply get a blank screen as
all drawing is being done on the surface, but the surface itself is
not being drawn anywhere. Therefore we now need to draw the surface
to the screen in the <b>Draw GUI</b> event like this:</p>

<p class="code">if surface_exists(surf)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw_surface_stretched(surf, 0, 0,
display_get_gui_width(), display_get_gui_height());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br></p>

<p>This code will now draw the surface that we have created from
the view stretched to fill the entire GUI layer.</p>
