<h1 class="studio">Deactivating Instances</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section deals with instance
deactivation.</h2>

<p><i>GameMaker: Studio</i> offers you the possibility to "switch
off" instances so that they are no longer processed in any way.
Technically they don't really exist anymore, except as a pointer
within the deactivation process itself, which means that a
deactivated instance cannot be manipulated or changed in any way at
all until it is re-activated again. So, these functions should be
used with great care as they can cause problems when not used
properly, particularly with persistent objects, as a persistent
object that has been deactivated <i>will not be moved to the next
room</i> unless it is re-activated first (effectively deleting it
from the game).<br>
<br>
It is normally not necessary to deactivate instances every step of
your game and this can actually cause your game to lag and runs
slow. Instead it is recommended that you only run these functions
every few steps in an alarm (for example), or if the view has
changed position, and it is especially important that you do
<i>not</i> use these functions in the draw event as this can lead
to serious errors in your game.<br>
<br>
A deactivated instance effectively ceases to exist in the game, but
<i>individual</i> instances can still have their variables
accessed. You cannot use <tt>with(object)</tt> or
<tt>with(instance)</tt> however, but rather you must access the
instance <i>directly</i> using it's unique <a href=
"../instance%20properties/id.html"><tt>id</tt></a> in the following
form:</p>

<p class="code">val = inst.variable;</p>

<p>In the above example, "inst" would be a variable that holds the
<tt>id</tt> of the deactivated instance, and this is the
<i>only</i> way that a deactivated instance can be referenced
without it being activated previously.<br>
<br></p>

<blockquote><i><b>NOTE:</b> If you deactivate an instance on room
start (ie:from the room creation code, or from an instance create
event of an instance within the room) all instances that are placed
within the room from the room editor <b>will still run their create
event</b> before being deactivated.</i><br>
<br>
<i><b>WARNING:</b> Deactivating instances that have physics enabled
will <b>NOT</b> stop their fixtures from interacting within the
physics simulation. For that you should set their <a href=
"../../../physics/physics%20variables/phy_active.html"><tt>phy_active</tt></a>
variable to <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> as you
activate/deactivate the instances.</i><br>
<br>
