<h1 class="studio">Push Notifications</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section deals with the functions for
pushing notifications to devices.</h2>

<p>On mobile devices, normally only one application can be active
in the foreground at any time, but many games and applications
operate in a time-based or interconnected environment where events
of interest to users can occur when the application is <i>not</i>
in the foreground. In these cases, <b>Local</b> and <b>Remote</b>
push notifications can allow these games to notify their users when
events occur.<br>
<br>
When the operating system delivers a local or remote push
notification and the target application is not running in the
foreground, it presents the notification to the user in the form of
a banner. If there is a notification alert and the user taps on it,
then the game is launched and an <a href=
"../../001_advanced%20use/more%20about%20async%20events/push.html">Asynchronous
Push Event</a> is called where you can check the callback string
that you specify and resolve the push based on its value. If the
application is running in the foreground when the notification is
delivered, the application will still receive an Asynchronous Push
Event, but the user will get no message displayed unless you create
it yourself.<br>
<br>
There are a few differences to note between supported
platforms:<br>
<br></p>

<ul>
<li>On Android, you will need to download and install the <a href=
"https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/2008/google-play-services"
target="_blank">Google Play Services Extension</a> before you can
use local notifications and also have enabled push notifications in
the <a href=
"../../001_advanced%20use/global%20game%20settings/android%20tab.html">
Android Social Global Game Settings</a>. Also note that <i>all</i>
notifications received when the app is not running/in background,
will be stored, and the data delivered by the async event the next
time the app runs.<br>
<br></li>

<li>On iOS, data for a particular notification will only be
delivered when the notification is selected (or if the app is
running in foreground when the notification is received).<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="studio">Local Notifications</h3>

<p>A local push notification is local to the device that the game
is installed on, and requires no backend server. You simply set the
date and time for the notification and it will be displayed to the
user if the game is not currently running. This type of
notification is useful to set "reminders" for the user to play your
game again, or to offer a daily reward for playing, etc... and when
the user taps the notification it will launch the game and pass in
a data string which can then be parsed by the game to give a reward
or whatever.<br>
<br>
The following functions are available for local notifications:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href=
"push_local_notification.html">push_local_notification</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href=
"push_get_first_local_notification.html">push_get_first_local_notification</a><br>

</li>

<li><a href=
"push_get_next_local_notification.html">push_get_next_local_notification</a><br>

</li>

<li><a href=
"push_cancel_local_notification.html">push_cancel_local_notification</a><br>

</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><i><b>NOTE</b>: This function is limited to the <b>iOS</b> and
<b>Android</b> target modules. on <b>Android</b> you will need to
have installed the <a href=
"https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/2008/google-play-services"
target="_blank">Google Play Services Extension</a> and have enabled
push notifications in the <a href=
"../../001_advanced%20use/global%20game%20settings/android%20tab.html">
Android Social Global Game Settings</a>.</i>
</p>

<h3 class="studio">Remote Notifications</h3>

<p>Remote notification messages are sent by a server to a service
provided by the device platform App Store, and this then forwards
those messages onto all the devices on which your application is
installed. This is supported by <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> on the iOS
and Android target modules.<br>
<br>
There are no functions in <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> to deal with
remote notifications, as they must all be generated by your server
and handled by the respective App Stores. However, once set up
correctly, <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> games will receive these
notifications, which can then be dealt with in the <a href=
"../../001_advanced%20use/more%20about%20async%20events/push.html">Asynchronous
Push Event</a>, as you would a local notification.<br>
<br>
For all available platforms, once you have done the necessary
set-up, when the game is run on a device it will <b>register</b>
that device with the platforms push notification service. This will
trigger an <b>Asynchronous Push Notification Event</b>, and the
<tt>ds_map</tt> key "<i>type</i>" will have the value
"<i>register</i>" as well as a new key, "<i>reg_id</i>", containing
the <b>registration id</b> (or an error message in the
"<i>error</i>" key, if "<i>status</i>" is 0). You must then send
this registration id to your server, and every device that your
game is installed on will have a different registration id. Your
server <i>must maintain a list of ids for registered devices</i>,
as when when you send a push notification message from your server,
you use the registration ids to send the message to the registered
devices.<br>
<br>
Please note that there is no guarantee that remote push
notifications will be delivered, and that the allowed data payload
is fairly small. This varies between platforms, but iOS is
particularly limited - the apple service only delivers the most
recent notification, which must be selected by the recipient for
the payload data to be delivered to your async event, and these
notifications have a mximum payload size of 256bytes. Typically a
remote push notification would just indicate that new data is
available from your server for example.</p>

<blockquote><i><b>NOTE</b>: Android requires that you add the
<b>GCM Sender ID</b> into the <a href=
"../../001_advanced%20use/global%20game%20settings/android%20tab.html">
Global Game Settings</a> for the platform. This is the <b>Project
Number</b> that is assigned when you create your Google Play API
Project.</i>
</blockquote>

entirely up to the end user, and YoYo Games do not provide any
support for that side of things, other than basic set-up
information available from their Knowledge Base.</i>
