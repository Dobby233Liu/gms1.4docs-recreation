<h1 class="studio">Obsolete Splash Functions</h1>

<h2 class="studio">These functions deal with splash screens and
videos.</h2>

<h3 class="studio"><b>Function List:</b>
</h3>

<div class="param">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Function</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>splash_show_video</td>
<td>Shows a video splash screen. fname is the name of the video
file. Whether a particular movie file is supported depends on the
drivers on the machine. Typically you can use .avi, .mpg, and .wmv
files but avoid special codecs. You best put this file in the
folder of the game yourself or in a subfolder. loop indicates
whether to loop the video.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="alt">
<td>splash_show_text</td>
<td>Shows a text splash screen. fname is the name of the text file.
You can either display standard text files (.txt) or rich text
files (.rtf). Only part of the rich text features are taken into
account. E.g. images and other embedded objects are not shown.
delay indicates the delay in milliseconds before returning to the
game. use 0 or a negative value to wait until the player presses
the escape key or clicks with the mouse in the window. (Note that
no scrollbar will be shown nor is there another way to scroll the
text. So the text must fit the window.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>splash_show_image</td>
<td>Shows an image splash screen. fname is the name of the image
file. Many image types are supported (for example .bmp, .jpg, .tif,
and .wmf) but no animated images. delay is the delay in milli
seconds before returning to the game.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="alt">
<td>splash_show_web</td>
<td>Shows a web page splash screen. url is the url of the webpage
(starting with http://) or it is the file name for a local html
file. Note however that you must provide the full path for this to
work. So you best e.g. use as url something like working_directory

returning to the game</td>
