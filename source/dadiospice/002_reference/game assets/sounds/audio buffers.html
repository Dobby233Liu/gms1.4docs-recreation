<h1 class="studio">Audio Buffers</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section covers the functions necessary to
use audio buffers for recording, streaming and queueing your audio
files.</h2>

<p>You can use <b>audio buffers</b> to load, save and manipulate
audio files within your games. These buffers are created beforehand
using the appropriate <a href="../../buffers/index.html">buffer
functions</a> and then you can use the following functions to
create a sound to use in your project:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href=
"audio_create_buffer_sound.html">audio_create_buffer_sound</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href=
"audio_free_buffer_sound.html">audio_free_buffer_sound</a><br>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that once you have created a sound from an audio buffer,
you are <i>not</i> creating a new sound in memory, but rather
pointing to the position within the buffer where the sound is
stored. You should not change this buffer after a sound has been
associated with it otherwise you will get unexpected results, and
you cannot delete the buffer while a sound is associated with it.
Instead, free the sound (or sounds) first then delete the buffer.
Once you have created your new audio resource from a buffer, you
can use it's index value in any of the regular audio functions to
play it, change it's gain or pitch, pause it, etc... Note that the
buffer used to load the audio <b>can only support PCM sounds</b>,
so formats like OGG will not be supported.<br>
<br>
Another feature of buffered audio is that you can use a buffer to
create a queue of audio which can then be streamed to the device
running your project. An audio queue takes a regular buffer which
you have previously filled with audio data, and enables you to
"point" to parts of it and tell GameMaker: Studio to stream the
audio in a given order from that buffer. The available functions
for audio queues are:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href=
"audio_create_play_queue.html">audio_create_play_queue</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href=
"audio_free_play_queue.html">audio_free_play_queue</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href="audio_queue_sound.html">audio_queue_sound</a><br>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Once a queue has been created, you can then use the returned
queue index just as you would the sound index for any normal sound
to play it, pause it, restart it, or change it's gain and pitch.
The only thing you cannot do is get the track length or set the
track position, but other than that, an audio queue can be used
just like any other sound. You should also note that some of the
audio queue functions will also trigger an <a href=
"../../../001_advanced%20use/more%20about%20async%20events/audio%20playback.html">
Audio Playback Asynchronous Event</a>.<br>
<br>
Audio buffers will also permit you to record sound from any of the
available sources (like microphones or the OS), which can then be
queued and streamed using the above functions (for example).
Recording audio will trigger an <a href=
"../../../001_advanced%20use/more%20about%20async%20events/audio%20recording.html">
Audio Recording Asynchronous Event</a> which will contain specific
information about what is being recorded.<br>
<br>
For recording audio, the following functions are available:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href=
"audio_start_recording.html">audio_start_recording</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href=
"audio_stop_recording.html">audio_stop_recording</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href=
"audio_get_recorder_count.html">audio_get_recorder_count</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href=
"audio_get_recorder_info.html">audio_get_recorder_info</a><br>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i><b>NOTE:</b> Most platforms support recording audio
in some form, but that does not mean that all devices will permit
it, even if the platform does, so you should always check that the
<a href=
"audio_get_recorder_count.html"><tt>audio_get_recorder_count()</tt></a>
function returns a value greater than 0 to verify that recording
devices are available before using the rest of the recording
functions.</i>
