<h1 class="studio">The Debug Module</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section explains how to use the Debug
Module to find and correct errors or issues in your games.</h2>

<p>The <b>Debug Module</b> is a powerful tool for checking your
game, and is especially useful for tracking down errors and bugs in
your code, as well as checking that scripts are run when they
should be, and that variables and arrays contain the values you
expect etc... You can start the Debug Module by running your game
from <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> using the <i>red</i>"Play" button at
the top of the IDE, or by going to the <b>Run</b> menu and
selecting "Run in Debug Mode".</p>

<blockquote><i><b>NOTE:</b> You may be prompted by Windows Firewall
(or any other firewall program that you run) to create a security
exception for this module. <b>You must do this</b> otherwise it
will not work correctly. This is due to the way the Debug Module
works and is essential for debugging mobile platforms.</i><br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE:</b> On devices the debug module will connect over WiFi
automatically, however should you have any configuration issues,
you will need to go to the <a href=
"preferences/scripts%20preferences.html">Preferences</a> and switch
on "Manual IP Entry". This will then let you specify the IP to
connect to manually, which will then be saved for future use.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>The actual Debug Module window will look something like this:
<img class="center" src="../images/form_debug.png"></p>

<p>At the top you have four drop down menus:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>File:</b> Here you can attempt to <i>reconnect</i> the debug
module to your game should the connection be lost, or exit the
debug module (which will not exit your game, only the module).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Window:</b> This menu contains options for the various
sub-windows that you can create for debugging. You can delete them
(clear all of them so that you can create a new watch layout), or
save the current layout or load a previously saved layout.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Debug:</b> From here you can pause or play the game being
debugged, or you can toggle a breakpoint on or off.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Help:</b> Opens up your browser, taking you to the YoYo
Games Helpdesk.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from these drop down menus, you also have a series of
buttons along the top with which you can control certain aspects of
your game and the Debug Modules interaction with it. These buttons
are:</p>

<blockquote>
<div style="float:left"><img src="../images/debug_play.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Play:</b> This starts the game again after it has been paused
(hotkey = <tt>f5</tt>).<br>
<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="../images/debug_pause.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Pause:</b> Pauses the game (hotkey = <tt>f6</tt>).<br>
<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="../images/debug_restart.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Restart:</b> Restarts the game.<br>
<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="../images/debug_stepin.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Step In:</b> Step into a code block or script (hotkey =
<tt>f11</tt>).<br>
<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="../images/debug_stepover.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Step Over:</b> Step over a code block or script (hotkey =
<tt>f10</tt>).<br>
<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="../images/debug_stepout.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Step Out:</b> Step out of a code block or script (hotkey =
<tt>&lt;SHIFT&gt; + f11</tt>).<br>
<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="../images/debug_realtime.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>RealTime Updates:</b> Turn on or off (it is off by default) real
time updates for the debug information.<br>
<br>
<br></blockquote>

<p>The first three buttons are used to control your game,
permitting you to start, stop and pause it at any time. When the
game is paused, you can then use the next three buttons for
"stepping" through your code. This simply means that you can tell
your game to run the current line of code, then step onto the next
one, permitting you to run through your entire game one line of
code at a time should you wish. Normally you would simply use the
<i>Step In</i> button to do this, but you also have one for
stepping over code and one for stepping out of the code. Stepping
over is useful when you have large scripts to run through, as
clicking this will run the whole script or code block as a single
step and stop on the next line afterwards, while stepping out will
take you out of a script (they will run, but all at once) and stop
on the next step. The final icon permits the debug window to update
its data in real time, so you can see how variables change or
instances are created and destroyed as it happens. Note that this
may affect the games performance and that not all information is
available in real time. For example, the <b>Render State</b> watch
cannot be viewed in real time.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Watches</h3>

<p>The whole idea of the Debug Module is to permit you to "watch"
every detail of your game. This is done using "watch windows" which
are opened on the right hand side of the debug module. To open a
new watch, simply click on an empty area (which should show the
text "select window type") or <i>right-click</i> on the top window
bar and choose a new "Type".</p>

<blockquote><i><b>NOTE:</b> Many of the watch windows (like Global,
Local or Watches) will <b>not</b> update while the game is running,
and will require that you pause the game or set a breakpoint before
they are updated.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also split the main watch area into multiple windows
using the "Split" option from the top window bar, permitting you to
organise the layout to suit your needs (and these layouts can also
be saved through the "Window" drop down menu). The type of window
that you choose to open will depend on what it is that you wish to
watch, with the following options available:</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 class="studio">Source</h4>

<p>The source window is where you can see the source code for your
game, and you can have multiple tabs open in this window, with each
tab showing the code from a different instance or event. If you do
a <i>right click</i> beside a line of code you can add a
<b>Breakpoint</b> to the code (see below for more details on
Breakpoints), and doing so again will remove it (you can also use
the key <tt>&lt;f9&gt;</tt>, or the toggle option from the "Debug"
drop down menu. If you have this window open, you can also
<i>double-click</i> on an event in any instance from the resource
tree and it's code will be shown in a new tab.<br>
<br></p>

<h4 class="studio">Globals</h4>

<p>The Globals window will show a list of all the currently
declared global variables and their values. If you
<i>right-click</i> on a value you can set its type (see <b>Data
Types</b>, below) to see details of data structures.<br>
<br></p>

<h4 class="studio">Locals</h4>

<p>The Locals window shows the current step properties, which
includes the name of the current event (or script) being run, the
position within the event (PC is "program counter"), the "self"
instance running the code block, and the "other" instance in the
event. This last part is only ever valid when the event is a
collision event or there is a <tt>with</tt> used in the code. If
the instance is in collision, "other" will show the other instance
(and it's variables) in the collision, but if it is a <tt>with</tt>
then the "Self" instance becomes that which is running the code,
while "Other" is then the instance that actually contains the
<tt>with</tt>. At all other times, "other" will simply show the
same data as "Self". After all this information, you will then find
a list of all <i>local</i> variables that are currently declared
for the code block being stepped through. If you <i>right-click</i>
on a value you can set its type (see <b>Data Types</b>, below) to
see details of data structures.<br>
<br></p>

<h4 class="studio">Watches</h4>

<p>This window is for you to add a specific variable that you want
to keep track of. This can be a global or instance scope variable,
a built in variable or even an array or data structure. If the the
instance code being stepped through has the watched variable it
will be shown here, meaning you can easily keep track of a value
without having to search for it in the Locals or Globals windows.
If you <i>right-click</i> on a value you can set its type (see
<b>Data Types</b>, below), delete it or clear <i>all</i> watches
from the window. You can also change some of the values for the
variables shown by simply <i>double-clicking</i> on the value and
giving it a new one. Note that you cannot re-asign arrays or data
structures in this way, but you <i>can</i> change some of their
contents (you cannot change the "key" values in maps, nor the
priority value for priority queues).<br>
<br></p>

<h4 class="studio">Instance</h4>

<p>As the name implies, this window will show all instance
variables, local variables and built in variables associated with
the instance currently being stepped through in the Source window
(if an instance is being referenced using the keyword "other" or
the <tt>with</tt> statement, then this window will show that
instances properties instead).<br>
<br></p>

<h4 class="studio">Output</h4>

<p>This window simply shows the output of the compiler (as shown in
the main IDE compiler window). If you <i>right-click</i> on the
window you can clear it or copy its contents to the clipboard.<br>
<br></p>

<h4 class="studio">All Instances</h4>

<p>Should you need to see all instances that are currently in the
room, you can select this window and they will be listed. You can
also see the state of any built in or instance variables that they
have, and you can <i>right-click</i> on a value to set its type
(see <b>Data Types</b>, below)<br>
<br></p>

<h4 class="studio">Selected Instance</h4>

<p>This window is for when you select an instance from your game.
This is done by simply pausing the game and then clicking on any
visible instance within the game window. The instance found beneath
the mouse cursor will then have its information displayed in the
Selected Instance window, where you can see it's built in and
instance variables, the same as for the Instances window.<br>
<br></p>

<h4 class="studio">Call Stack</h4>

<p>This window will display the current call stack of events, as
well as the line number for the code being stepped through.<br>
<br></p>

<h4 class="studio">Buffer</h4>

<p>If you have initialised any buffers in your game, then this
window will show you the buffer data. You can select any buffer
created by setting the <i>Buffer ID</i> value, which will start at
0 for the first buffer created in your game, and increment by 1 for
each consecutive buffer. <img class="center" src=
"../images/form_debug_buffer.png"> If you <i>right-click</i> on the
data window, you can select how the data is displayed, setting the
alignment and type, and you can also set how the data is laid out
from the <i>Columns</i> box. There is a drop-down window here where
you can select from a default list of layouts, or you can click the
box and input your own value. Note that for large buffers,
scrolling down through the data will require that you scroll, then
<i>release</i> the mouse button for the Debug Module to fetch and
display the required data.<br>
<br></p>

<h4 class="studio">Profile</h4>

<p>This window is where you can see the current system profile for
the game being tested where you can check everything in your game
from whole events to individual function calls to see how they are
performing and spot any trouble areas or bottlenecks. For further
information on profiling see the section below:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href="profiling.html">Profiling</a>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="studio">Graph</h4>

<p>The Graph window shows you a graphic display of how your game is
performing. You can see the memory use, or how the GML is
performing on the CPU, or a combination of both. You can change
views easily by clicking the drop-down tab on the right and
selecting the option you require. <img class="center" src=
"debug_graph.png"></p>

<h4 class="studio">Render States</h4>

<p>This watch shows you all the information available for the state
of the current frame being rendered, like the draw alpha or fill
colour. this cannot be updated in real time so you will need to
pause the game to get and update the frame details.<br>
<br></p>

<h4 class="studio">Surfaces/Textures</h4>

<p>This watch enables you to see exactly what is being drawn to any
surfaces you have in your game (including the <tt>application
surface</tt>) as well as see the texture pages that are in memory.
You can select from textures or surfaces from the top of the watch,
and then select the texture or surface ID to have it displayed in
the window. <img class="center" src="debug_textures.png"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to note that while the game is running it
<i>doesn't update the debug windows with variable values and other
details by default</i>, therefore you must first use the "Pause"
button in the Debug Module to pause the game before Locals, Globals
and other data will be available, or enable real-time updating from
the icons at the top. The only exception to this rule is the
<i>Profile</i> view, which updates in real time when enabled
independently of the real-time switch, as it has its own on/off
button.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Data Types</h3>

<p>When you are watching a variable in any of the windows, it can
be one of multiple <b>data-types</b>. However, due to the way that
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> stores certain things, the Debug Module
does not always know just what the variable holds. This is because
the internal ID values for data structures or instances are
integers and so the Debug Module doesn't always know if the integer
value being stored in a variable is for a data structure or an
instance or is simply an integer value. For that reason, you can
<i>right-click</i> on any variable value and get a pop-up window
that lists the available data-types that this variable could be.
Strings and arrays do not permit this option, and it is worth
noting that even if a data structure is stored in an instance
variable, its ID number is <b>global</b>, so if you have four
instances and each one creates a ds_list (for example), each list
will have an id from 0 to 3, and they won't all be 0.<br>
<br>
Once you have selected your data-type, the variable will then show
the entries in the structure simply by clicking the small "+" next
to its name. This will expand the structures contents, and, in the
case of the "Watches" window, permit you to modify them too.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Breakpoints</h3>

<p>A breakpoint is a place in your game code that you wish it to
stop at so you can see what's going on. With the Debug Module, you
can set these at any time and in any code block, and you can also
set them from the <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> IDE. When making your
game, they can be added at any time using <tt>f9</tt> (or using the
right mouse button and selecting "toggle breakpoint"), either on an
action in the object window, or on a line in a code editor window.
Now, when you run your game in debug mode it will pause at the
point (or points) that you have defined. Breakpoints set from the
IDE are saved along with your game and persist over various runs,
however if you add a breakpoint to your code in the Debug Module,
this will be lost after the module is closed, or a new test run
started.<br>
