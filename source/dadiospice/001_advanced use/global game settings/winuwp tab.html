<h1 class="studio">The Windows UWP Tab</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section deals with the Windows UWP tab of
the Global Games Settings Window.</h2>

<p>In the Global Games Settings of GameMaker: Studio, you can find
the different setup options related to how your final game will
look when you create the executable for the target platform. Here
we will look at the <b>Windows UWP</b> tab. It is split into three
sub-tabs, each of which is explained in the sections below:<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">General</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="winuwp_general.png"> This section is
where you should set up the details of your app like its name and
any associated graphics. Below is a list of all the available
options and what they represent:<br>
<br></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Display Name</b>: Specifies the friendly name for the app
that is displayed to users (this string is localizable).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Package Name</b>: This is the name of the package that you
have created and should match that used for the <b>Developer
key</b> that you have created for the game (see the <i>Installation
Sub-Tab, below).</i></li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Package Display Name</b>: This is the "short name" of the
package and should Ideally be the same as the Display Name</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Publisher Display Name</b>: This is the name of your company
or the person that you wish to associate as the games
publisher.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Version</b>: The version number of your game.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Orientations</b>: Specifies the orientations in which the
game would prefer to be shown for the best user experience. The
available options are:

<dl>
<dd>Landscape</dd>

<dd>Portrait</dd>

<dd>Landscape-flipped</dd>

<dd>Portrait-flipped</dd>
</dl>
On devices that can be rotated, such as tablets, the game won't be
redrawn for orientations that aren't specified with this property -
for example, the game won't rotate if the device is rotated to a
Portrait orientation but the property specifies only Landscape and
Landscape-flipped orientations. On devices that <i>can't</i> be
rotated, a game might be shown in that device's default
orientation, and the game's preferred orientation will be ignored,
however, your game's preferred rotation <i>will</i> be honored on
devices on which a rotation lock has been activated. These
orientation preference choices apply to both the splash screen and
the game itself every time a new instance is launched.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Splash Screen</b>: This is the screen that will be shown
when you start your game, and it cannot be larger than 620 x 300
pixels. Click on the <b>Update</b> button to change it, then select
set the <b>Background colour</b> for it.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Logos</b>: These are the Windows 10 tile and icon logos that
your game will use. It is worth noting that these images can be
transparent <tt>*.png</tt> files, in which case they will be drawn
over the <b>Background colour</b> specified in the appropriate
section.<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE</b>: The background colour specified here also applies
to the button colour in any app-owned dialog boxes and to the App
Description page in the Store!</i><br>
<br>

<dl>
<dd>- The large square image is the large live tile format and
should be 310 x 310 pixels. Note that this will <i>only</i> be used
on the desktop OS.<br>
<br></dd>

<dd>- The next image is the wide version of the logo image, which
appears when the tile appears in its wide format and should be 310
x 150 pixels. If this image isn’t provided, the tile can display
only in the square format and can’t accept notifications based on
wide template types. Since the user can decide which format the
tile uses it is recommended that you include a wide logo image.
Also note that if a wide logo image is provided, the tile may
appear initially in its wide format.<br>
<br></dd>

<dd>- The next square image specifies the smaller logo that appears
in the tile to identify the game in the normal sized, square tile.
It should be 150 x 150 pixels.<br>
<br></dd>

<dd>- The final tile icon is for the small tile and should be a
71x71 pixel image.<br>
<br></dd>

<dd>- The smallest icon is the logo image that appears next to the
App name in the search bar and other areas of the UI.<br>
<br></dd>
</dl></li>

<li><b>Store Logo</b>: Sets the icon to be used when shown in the
Windows Store and it should be an image of 50x50px.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Foreground Text</b>: Sets the value of the text colour
relative to the background colour on the app’s tile in Windows. The
value is either “Light” or “Dark”.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="studio">Graphics</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="winuwp_graphics.png"> In this section
you can set the way that your game should react to being scaled in
any way (either by dragging the window borders or by full screening
it), and this can either be <b>Keep Aspect Ratio</b> or <b>Fill
Screen</b>. Next is the option to set the size of the <b>Texture
Page</b>. The default (and most compatible) size is 1024x1024, but
you can choose from anywhere between 256x256 up to 8192x8192. There
is also a button marked <b>Preview</b> which will generate the
texture pages for this platform and then open a window so that you
can see how they look. This can be very useful if you wish to see
how the texture pages are structured and to prevent having texture
pages larger (or smaller) than necessary.<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE:</b> Be aware that the larger the size of the texture
page, the less compatible your game will be.</i><br>
<br>
<i><b>WARNING!</b> Switching off the application surface will
disable all the scaling options set in the Global Game Settings
until it has been switched back on again. See <a href=
"../../002_reference/surfaces/the%20application%20surface.html">The
Application Surface</a> for further details.</i><br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Installation</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="winuwp_installation.png"> For your game
to run on the UWP platform it has to be certified correctly, and
this is done from the Installation tab. You will first be required
to give your publisher name, which is formatted as
<tt>CN=&lt;publisher_name_here&gt;</tt>, and then give a path to
your <b>Developer Key</b>. <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> supplies a
default Developer Key for WindowsUWP development, but it is
recommended that you generate your own and point to it here. To do
this, create an empty project in <i>Visual Studio Express</i> then
store somewhere safe a copy of the automatically generated
<tt>*.pfx</tt> (the developer key) that it will have included in
the empty project. You should then link that <tt>*.pfx</tt> file
here.<br>
<br>
After linking to the file, you should click on the associated
<b>Install</b> button and then follow the instructions in the
command prompt that will open. If you do <i>not</i> do this then
using the <b>Run/Debug</b> buttons (or hitting F5) will fail and
your game cannot be tested (however, if you use <b>Create
Application</b> the certification installation process will
automatically be launched if the <tt>*.pfx</tt> has yet to be
registered).<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE:</b> When it comes to uploading your app to the store
you will need to get the</i> correct <tt>*.pfx</tt> for your title.
This is done via associating your app with the Windows Store in
Visual Studio which causes Visual Studio to generate a new
<tt>*.pfx</tt> specifically for the app. It is also worth noting
that you can associate any app with the Windows Store in Visual
Studio, meaning you can associate a blank project with the Windows
Store app and simply copy the generated pfx to a safe location
which can then be used within Global Game Settings.<br>
<br>
The final option is to select the CPU architecture to target. You
can choose between <b>x86&lt;&amp;b&gt;,</b> x64 or <b>ARM</b>.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Permissions</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="winuwp_permissions.png"> Depending on
what you want your game to have access to, you may also need to
check the permissions from the <b>Permissions</b> tab. If your game
uses (for example) the function <tt>url_open()</tt> then you would
need to check the "Use Internet" box. The available permissions
are:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Use Internet</b>: Marks the game as having access to
internet.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Use Microphone</b>: Marks the game as having access to the
microphone of the device.</li>
</ul>
