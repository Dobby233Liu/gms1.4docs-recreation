<h1 class="studio">The Windows 8 Tab</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section deals with the Windows 8 tab of the
Global Games Settings Window.</h2>

<p>In the Global Games Settings of GameMaker: Studio, you can find
the different setup options related to how your final game will
look when you create the executable for the target platform. Here
we will look at the <b>Windows 8</b> tab. It is split into three
sub-tabs, each of which is explained in the sections below:<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">General</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="win8_general.png"> This section is
where you should set up the details of your app like its name and
any associated graphics. Below is a list of all the available
options and what they represent:<br>
<br></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Display Name</b>: Specifies the friendly name for the app
that is displayed to users (this string is localizable).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Package Name</b>: This is the name of the package that you
have created and should match that used for the <b>Developer
key</b> that you have created for the game (see the <i>Installation
Sub-Tab, below).</i></li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Package Display Name</b>: This is the "short name" of the
package and should Ideally be the same as the Display Name</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Publisher Display Name</b>: This is the name of your company
or the person that you wish to associate as the games
publisher.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Version</b>: The version number of your game.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Orientations</b>: Specifies the orientations in which the
game would prefer to be shown for the best user experience. The
available options are:

<dl>
<dd>Landscape</dd>

<dd>Portrait</dd>

<dd>Landscape-flipped</dd>

<dd>Portrait-flipped</dd>
</dl>
On devices that can be rotated, such as tablets, the game won't be
redrawn for orientations that aren't specified with this property -
for example, the game won't rotate if the device is rotated to a
Portrait orientation but the property specifies only Landscape and
Landscape-flipped orientations. On devices that <i>can't</i> be
rotated, a game might be shown in that device's default
orientation, and the game's preferred orientation will be ignored,
however, your game's preferred rotation <i>will</i> be honored on
devices on which a rotation lock has been activated. These
orientation preference choices apply to both the splash screen and
the game itself every time a new instance is launched.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Splash Screen</b>: This is the screen that will be shown
when you start your game, and it cannot be larger than 620 x 300
pixels. Click on the <b>Update</b> button to change it, then select
set the <b>Background colour</b> for it.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Logos</b>: These are the Windows8 tile and icon logos that
your game will use. It is worth noting that these images can be
transparent <tt>*.png</tt> files, in which case they will be drawn
over the <b>Background colour</b> specified in the appropriate
section.<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE</b>: The background colour specified here also applies
to the button colour in any app-owned dialog boxes and to the App
Description page in the Store!</i><br>
<br>

<dl>
<dd>- The large image is the wide version of the logo image, which
appears when the tile appears in its wide format and should be 310
x 150 pixels. If this image isn’t provided, the tile can display
only in the square format and can’t accept notifications based on
wide template types. Since the user can decide which format the
tile uses it is recommended that you include a wide logo image.
Also note that if a wide logo image is provided, the tile will
appear initially in its wide format.<br>
<br></dd>

<dd>- The square image specifies the smaller logo that appears in
the tile to identify the game in the normal sized, square tile. It
should be 150 x 150 pixels.<br>
<br></dd>

<dd>- The next image is the store icon, which is a 50x50 pixel
image.<br>
<br></dd>

<dd>- The final small icon is the logo image that appears next to
the App name in the search bar and other areas of the UI.<br>
<br></dd>
</dl></li>

<li><b>Foreground Text</b>: Sets the value of the text colour
relative to the background colour on the app’s tile in Windows. The
value is either “Light” or “Dark”.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><i><b>WARNING:</b> If you have <b>any</b> functions in your
Windows 8 game that require an internet connection, like an open
URL call for example, then you <b>must</b> have the
"<b>internetClientServer</b>" capability ticked for the game.
Microsoft also specifies that if you use this capability you
<b>need to add a link to your Privacy Policy</b> in the Settings
pane of your Windows 8 game (see <a href=
"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464936.aspx#internet_and_public_networks"
target="_blank">here</a> for further details). This can be done
using the <a href=
"../../002_reference/windows8/index.html">Settings Charm
Functions</a> in your game.</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<h3 class="studio">Graphics</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="win8_graphics.png"> Here is the option
to set the size of the <b>Texture Page</b>. The default (and most
compatible) size is 1024x1024, but you can choose from anywhere
between 256x256 up to 2048x2048. There is also a button marked
<b>View</b> which will generate the texture pages for this platform
and then open a window so that you can see how they look. This can
be very useful if you wish to see how the texture pages are
structured and to prevent having texture pages larger (or smaller)
than necessary.<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE:</b> Be aware that the larger the size of the texture
page, the less compatible your game will be.</i><br>
<br>
You can also set the way that your game should react to being
scaled in any way (either by dragging the window borders or by full
screening it). This can either be <b>keep Aspect Ratio</b> or
<b>Stretch</b>. There are also extra options for <b>Native</b>
Windows 8 apps, which permit you switch on or off interpolation and
v-sync for the game.<br>
<br>
<i><b>WARNING!</b> Switching off the application surface will
disable all the scaling options set in the Global Game Settings
until it has been switched back on again. See <a href=
"../../002_reference/surfaces/the%20application%20surface.html">The
Application Surface</a> for further details.</i><br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Installation</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="win8_installation.png"> <i>GameMaker:
Studio</i> supplies two default <b>Developer Keys</b> for Windows8
development (one each for the <b>Native</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>
modules), but it is recommended that you generate your own and
point to it here. To do this, create an empty project in <i>Visual
Studio Express</i> then store somewhere safe a copy of the
automatically generated <tt>*.pfx</tt> (the developer key) that it
will have included in the empty project. You should then link that
<tt>*.pfx</tt> file here.<br>
<br>
After linking to the file, you should click on the associated
<b>Install</b> button and then follow the instructions in the
command prompt that will open. If you do <i>not</i> do this then
using the <b>Run/Debug</b> buttons (or hitting F5) will fail and
your game cannot be tested (however, if you use <b>Create
Application</b> the certification installation process will
automatically be launched if the <tt>*.pfx</tt> has yet to be
registered).<br>
<br>
Finally, for <b>Native</b> Windows 8 development there is a drop
down menu where you can select the device to target, which can be
either <b>x86</b> or <b>ARM</b>.<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE:</b> When it comes to uploading your app to the store
you will need to get the</i> correct <tt>*.pfx</tt> for your title.
This is done via associating your app with the Windows Store in
Visual Studio which causes Visual Studio to generate a new
<tt>*.pfx</tt> specifically for the app. It is also worth noting
that you can associate any app with the Windows Store in Visual
Studio, meaning you can associate a blank project with the Windows
Store app and simply copy the generated pfx to a safe location
which can then be used within Global Game Settings.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Permissions</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="win8_permissions.png"> Depending on
what you want your game to have access to, you may also need to
check the permissions from the <b>Permissions</b> tab. If your game
uses (for example) the function <tt>url_open()</tt> then you would
need to check the "Use Internet" box. The available permissions
are:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Use Internet</b>: Marks the game as having access to
internet.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Use Search</b>: Marks the game as having access to the
Windows8 search functions.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Use Microphone</b>: Marks the game as having access to the
microphone of the device.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>
</ul>
