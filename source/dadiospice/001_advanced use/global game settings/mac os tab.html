<h1 class="studio">The Mac OS Tab</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section deals with the Mac OS tab of the
Global Games Settings Window.</h2>

<p>This MacOS tab is split into three separate <i>sub-tabs</i>
(accessible on the left of the window) to make changing and
updating the information for your game clearer and less
complicated. These tabs are explained in the following
sections.</p>

<h3 class="studio">General</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="mac_general_tab.png"> The first thing
to do is fill in the <b>Display Name</b> of your game then go down
to the <i>Product Information</i> section and fill in its
<b>Version Number</b>, <b>App id</b>, <b>App Output</b> file and
the <b>Copyright</b> details. The <b>App Output</b> is the location
to which your game installation files go to on your Mac. When you
create your <tt>.app.zip</tt>, that file can go anywhere (the
location you specify when doing the save dialogue is not the only
copy made of that .app.zip), but the .pkg and other files are left
in this folder, permitting you to test local installations via
Terminal in such a way as to simulate Mac Store purchasing,
etc...<br>
<br>
Once that is done you will need to give your game <b>Icons</b> and
a <b>Splash Screen</b>. The icons should be authored as a single
*.png file with a size of 1024x1024px. The splash screen should be
the size of the first room in your game as this is what will
briefly be shown while the game assets are being loaded. Smaller or
larger images are permitted but will be scaled to fit.<br>
<br>
Once you have configured the game details and presentation
graphics, you should configure the two following options:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Allow menu and dock in fullscreen</b> - When checked, this
option will show the OS menu and dock if the game is in fullscreen
mode.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Display the cursor</b> - This toggles the mouse cursor
visibility in your game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally we have the option to give a <b>Team Identifier</b>. You
can leave this blank to use the default Team Identifier as set in
the <a href="../preferences/mac%20preferences.html">Mac OS
Preferences</a>.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Graphics</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="mac_graphics_tab.png"> The graphics
options will determine how your game is displayed when run and
affect the way things like scaling and interpolation are handled.
The following options exist:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Start in fullscreen mode</b> - If this is checked, the game
will start in fullscreen mode.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Interpolate colours between pixels</b> - Turns on
interpolation, which basically "smooths" pixels. for crisp pixel
graphics, it should be off, but if you have nice alpha blends and
smoothed edge graphics it is better left on.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Use synchronization to avoid tearing</b> - This toggles
v-sync on or off. Note, that if you have a game with a room speed
of 120 and the player has a monitor with a refresh rate of 60,
turning this option on will lock your game speed to 60 too.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Allow the player to resize the game window</b> - Checking
this permits the user to change the size of the game window.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Scaling</b> - Here you can choose to maintain aspect ratio
(so a 4:3 room will be "letter boxed" on a 16:9) or to scale fully
(stretching the image to fit the full screen).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Allow switching to fullscreen</b> - Checking this will allow
the user to toggle the game from windowed to fullscreen mode using
<i>&lt;CTRL&gt; + &lt;CMD&gt; + &lt;F&gt;</i>.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><i><b>WARNING!</b> Switching off the application surface will
disable all the scaling options set in the Global Game Settings
until it has been switched back on again. See <a href=
"../../002_reference/surfaces/the%20application%20surface.html">The
Application Surface</a> for further details.</i><br>
<br>
Finally there is the option to set the size of the <b>Texture
Page</b>. The default (and most compatible) size is 2048x2048, but
you can choose from anywhere between 256x256 up to a whopping
8192x8192! There is also a button marked <b>View</b> which will
generate the texture pages for this platform and then open a window
so that you can see how they look. This can be very useful if you
wish to see how the texture pages are structured and to prevent
having texture pages larger (or smaller) than necessary.<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE:</b> Be aware that the larger the size of the texture
page, the less compatible your game will be.</i><br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">AppStore</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="mac_appstore_tab.png"> If you wish the
finished game to be <i>App Store Ready</i> then you need to check
the <b>Build for Mac App Store</b> option, but be aware that this
will only function if you are a registered Developer and have the
necessary certificates. Under that are two sub-options that you
should <i>only check if they are true</i> as Apple can reject your
app if they are checked when they are not needed or vice-versa.
These options simply permit your game to use the <a href=
"../../002_reference/asynchronous%20functions/http_get.html"><tt>http_</tt></a>
and <a href=
"../../002_reference/html5/url_open.html"><tt>url_</tt></a>
functions. It is worth noting that if you wish to support GamePads
in your game then the option to create an App Store ready package
should be <i>off</i>.<br>
<br>
Finally, you need to select its <b>App Category</b> (for more
information, see <a href=
"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/General/SubmittingToMacAppStore/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010572-CH16-SW8">
here</a>).<br>
