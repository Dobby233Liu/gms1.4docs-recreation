<h1 class="studio">Drawing Tools</h1>

<h2 class="studio">The drawing tools are those used in the image
editor to manipulate and create sprites or backgrounds.</h2>

<p>Below you can find a list of all the available drawing tools for
use in the <a href="editing%20subimages.html">Image Editor</a>.<br>
<br></p>

<blockquote>
<div style="float:left"><img src="pencil.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Pencil</b><br>
<br>
With this tool you can paint on the image, using either the left or
the right mouse button (the colours can be set independently) and
the size of the area being painted can be set by selecting the one
of the sizes from the section beneath the draw tools. If you hold
&lt;Shift&gt; when starting to paint you only paint horizontal or
vertical lines and if you hold the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key, the cursor
temporarily turns into the colour dropper allowing you to select
another colour from the image and then continue painting.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="airbrush.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Airbrush</b><br>
<br>
With this tool you can "airbrush" paint onto the image. Airbrushing
works like the pencil except that the brush is partially
transparent at the sides and has a certain texture to it. You can
use the left or right mouse button to paint in the different
colours you have selected and you can set the size of the brush
using the buttons at the bottom. There is also a "hardness" setting
for this brush which lets you adjust the transparency of the edges
of the lines you paint. As with the pencil tool, if you hold
&lt;Shift&gt; when starting to paint you only paint horizontal or
vertical lines and if you hold the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key, the cursor
temporarily turns into the colour dropper allowing you to select
another colour from the image and then continue painting.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="eraser.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Eraser</b><br>
<br>
With this tool you can erase parts the image. It works a lot like
the airbrush but erasing what is below the mouse rather than
drawing. How much you erase depends on the opacity setting, where a
value of 255 will erase completely down to 0 which will erase
nothing, with all values in between making the image a bit more
transparent. You can also set the hardness of the eraser so that it
has softer or harder edges and if you hold &lt;Shift&gt; when you
start to spray, you only paint horizontal or vertical lines. Note
that you can use the <i>right mouse button</i> on the eraser and it
will change the right colour to use the eraser settings, permitting
LMB paint / RMB erase, as used in many popular paint programs.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="colourdropper.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>colour Picker</b><br>
<br>
With this tool you can use the left or right mouse button to select
the colour directly beneath as the draw colour for that button.
Note that the opacity value is also set.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="line.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Draw A Line</b><br>
<br>
Use this tool to draw straight lines, with the width of the line
set by you in the options below, where you can also choose to have
it draw an arrow rather than just a line. By checking
<b>Anti-alias</b> the line is drawn with partially transparent
pixels on the side to make it appear smoother and if you hold
&lt;Shift&gt; when drawing then you can snap to draw horizontal,
vertical, or 45° diagonal lines only.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="poligon.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Draw A Polygon</b><br>
<br>
With this tool you can draw a closed polygon. You start by clicking
on the position of the first vertex, then you can either drag to
the position of the next vertex or just click there, and then
continue to add more points until you have the shape you wish to
create. You can end the polygon with the &lt;Esc&gt; key or by
selecting another tool from the menu. As with the other tools, you
can hold &lt;Shift&gt; to draw horizontal, vertical, or 45°
diagonal lines and you can set the width of the line and whether
the polygon should be filled or not. By checking <b>Anti-alias</b>
the polygon is drawn with partially transparent pixels on the side
to make it appear smoother.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="rectangle.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Draw A Rectangle</b><br>
<br>
Use this tool to draw a rectangle, or, if you hold &lt;Shift&gt;, a
square. You can set the width of the outside line and whether the
rectangle should be filled or not from the options at the bottom,
and by checking <b>Anti-alias</b> the rectangle is drawn with
partially transparent pixels on the side to make it appear
smoother.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="ellipse.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Draw An Ellipse</b><br>
<br>
Use this tool to draw an ellipse, or, if you hold &lt;Shift&gt;, a
circle. You can set the width of the outside line and whether the
ellipse should be filled or not from the options at the bottom, and
by checking <b>Anti-alias</b> the ellipse is drawn with partially
transparent pixels on the side to make it appear smoother.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="select.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Select A Region</b><br>
<br>
With this tool you can select a rectangular region for copying,
cutting, or moving. The selection is made by clicking a position
and dragging the mouse, which will create a rectangular area
bounded by a dotted line. This area can then be clicked on again to
"pick it up" and move it around the image with the mouse. If you
use the right mouse button, then you will get the same effect, only
you will have a copy of the selected region. You can extend the
current selection by holding the &lt;Shift&gt; key, you can remove
parts by holding the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key, you can delete the contents
of the selection with the &lt;Del&gt; key, and you can clear the
selection using the &lt;Esc&gt; key.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="wand.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Select With Magic Wand</b><br>
<br>
In this case you make the selection by clicking on a pixel, and all
touching pixels with the same colour and within the set tolerance
will be selected. You can indicate the tolerance with which to
select pixels and whether only the colour or also the transparency
value should match from the options beneath the toolbox. As above,
you can extend the current selection by holding the &lt;Shift&gt;
key, and you can remove parts by holding the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key. Once
you have the selection you can manipulate it as explained
above.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="sprayselect.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Select With Brush</b><br>
<br>
With this tool you make the selection by "brushing" with the mouse
on the image. You can set the size of the brush using the controls
beneath the toolbox, and the selection can be treated as explained
for the above tools.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="type.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Add Text</b><br>
<br>
Use this to add text to the image. You start by clicking the image
and a pop-up window appears in which you can enter the text (you
can use the # symbol to insert a newline), and once you press
<b>OK</b> the text is put in the image, with a selection box around
it. You can now move the text by clicking and dragging it with the
mouse. If you wish to change the text, simply click with the right
mouse button in the box. You can also change the font and alignment
(left justified, right justified or centered) from the options that
are beneath the toolbox.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="fill.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Flood Fill</b><br>
<br>
Click on a point in the image, with either the left or the right
mouse button, and all touching pixels with the same colour or
within the tolerance setting will be turned into the chosen colour.
You can set the tolerance with which the colour should match from
the settings beneath the toolbox, and you can also set whether to
only match on the colour value or also take the transparency value
into account too. Note that when the colour Mode is set to Blend
the fill colour is blended with the existing one, and to replace
it, set the colour Mode to Replace.<br>
<br>

<div style="float:left"><img src="changecolour.png">
</div>
<br>
<b>Change colour</b><br>
<br>
When you click with either the left or right mouse button using
this tool, all pixels in the image with the same colour or within
the set tolerance will be turned into the new colour. You can set
the tolerance with which the colour should match from the settings
beneath the toolbox, and you can also set whether to only match on
the colour value or also take the transparency value into account
too. Note that when the colour Mode is set to Blend the fill colour
is blended with the existing one, and to replace it, set the colour
Mode to Replace.<br>
