<h1 class="studio">Object Physics Properties</h1>

<h2 class="studio">You can set a number of physical properties for
an object that will set how it behaves when placed in a physics
world.</h2>

<p>When you first create a new object resource, there is a checkbox
at the bottom on the left marked <b>Uses Physics</b>, which is
normally not checked. Selecting this option will radically change
the behaviour of your object when an instance of it is placed in a
room, as this switches on the object's physical properties and
means that its "traditional" movement and collision functions are
no longer valid (but only when the room it is placed on is also
marked as being a physics room. See - <a href=
"../more%20about%20rooms/physics.html">More About Rooms:
Physics</a>). When you check this, the object resource window
expands to show the following: <img class="center" src=
"physicsproperties.png"></p>

<h3 class="studio">Collision Shape</h3>

<p>With the normal collision system you had your collisions based
off of the mask of the sprite assigned to the object, but with the
physics switched on, this is no longer the case. We need to assign
a mask to the object ourselves (actually, this is really a
"fixture", see <a href="../../002_reference/physics/index.html">The
Physics Functions</a> for more information), which can either be a
circle, a rectangle or a polygon shape that you yourself define.
Once you have selected the shape you can then click on the
<b>Modify Collision Shape</b> button which will open the following
window: <img class="center" src="physics_shape.png"> This looks
similar to the <a href="../004_paths.html">Path Editor</a>, and
functions in much the same way, however, depending on the mask you
have chosen, it can be rather more restrictive:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If you have a circular mask, then you can only pull any of the
path points to make the circle diameter larger or smaller</li>

<li>If you have rectangular mask, then you can move any of the four
corners, but the corresponding ones will adjust position
automatically to always maintain a rectangle</li>

<li>If you have a custom mask, it <i>must</i> have a minimum of 3
and a maximum of 8 points to it, and it <i>must</i> be convex (see
image below).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="convexconcave.png">
</p>

<h3 class="studio">Physics Properties</h3>

<p>Once you have set up your shape, you then need to define the
basic physical properties that your object is to have. These are
configured by changing the following parameters:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Density:</b> The density of something is defined as its mass
per unit volume, which basically means how much mass is crammed
into the space it takes up in the world. So, a balloon would have a
low density as it has little mass that occupies a large space,
while a lead bar would have a high density as it has a great mass,
yet occupies little space. In the GameMaker: Studio 2D physics
world mass is calculated automatically for you from the values you
input for the density and by the surface area of the shape you
define for the fixture. This will have a direct impact on how much
inertia a fixture has as well as how it reacts to collisions and
forces, so if you make a small shape with a high density it will
have a very large mass (like a bar of lead), but if you define a
large shape with a low density it will have a much smaller mass
(like a ballon).<br></li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Restitution:</b> In physics, restitution is defined as "the
return of an object or system to its original state after elastic
deformation", but as the fixtures in the GameMaker: Studio are
really rigid bodies and cannot be deformed, restitution is really a
way of saying how "bouncy" the fixture is. This setting will affect
how much an object "bounces" when it collides with other objects
and is co-dependant on other forces that act on the instance like
gravity and friction.<br></li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Collision Group:</b> By default, the collision group for all
physics objects is 0, and this means that they will interact as
normal, which means they <i>must</i> have a collision event to
interact (a simple comment will do to trigger the collision)
otherwise no collision will be registered. However, you can also
specify that an object should belong to a specific <i>collision
group</i>. Now, by assigning objects to a <b>positive</b> collision
group (ie: three objects are all in group "2") you are telling
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> that instances of these objects should
<i>always</i> collide, even if they have nothing in their collision
event, obeying the physical properties that you have assigned them
and the room they are in. Conversely, if you have objects with a
<b>negative</b> collision group (ie: four objects assigned "-1"),
you are telling <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> that these should
<i>never</i> collide, and any collision events between them will be
ignored. <i><b>Note:</b></i> Using collision groups dramatically
increases the processing required by the physics system and should
be used only when absolutely necessary, and you should have as few
groups as possible!<br></li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Linear Damping:</b> Damping is used to reduce the physics
world velocity of an instance, and differs from friction in that
friction only occurs when two instances with collision shapes
(fixtures) are in contact. Damping is also much cheaper to simulate
than friction, but please note that damping is not a replacement
for friction; the two effects can, and should, be used
together.<br></li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Angular Damping:</b> If you think about any rotating object
in the "real world", unless it has a motor or is in space, it slows
down over time due to the influence of external forces (like
friction with the air around it). We can use set this option to
simulate this effect and reduce the velocity of rotation of
instances in the physics world, as, without it, any rotating
instance would continue to rotate infinitely.<br></li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Friction:</b> Friction is the force that resists the
relative motion of material elements sliding against each other,
which in the GameMaker: Studio physics world, translates as the
loss of momentum caused by the collision of two instances with
fixtures bound to them. So, when two instances collide, their
motion is affected by this value, with a high friction causing a
larger loss of momentum than a lower value.<br></li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally there are three extra options that can flagged as on or
off for your fixture, <b>Sensor</b>, <b>Start Awake</b> and
<b>Kinematic</b>. Each of these flags will change the behaviour of
your fixture in the following ways:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Sensor</b> - By checking this box, you are telling
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> to basically "ignore" the physical
properties of the object, but still return a collision event with
the objects around it. in this way you can have an instance with no
physical presence in the room, but which can react to the collision
of another instance, like the player, and do something in turn,
like open a door, or trigger some sort of action in another place
in the room.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Start Awake</b> - This is checked by default and represents
the initial "state" of the fixture at the start of the room it has
been placed in. Normally you want it to be <i>awake</i> (ie:
participating in the physics world) right from the start, but
sometimes this can lead to certain instabilities and unwanted
effects due to the abrupt start of the physics simulation. To avoid
these effects, you can un-check this flag and the instance will be
created with the fixture <i>asleep</i>, and it will not participate
in the physics simulation unless something acts upon it.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Kinematic</b> - There will be certain instances in a physics
based game which you want to move around but do not wish to be
acted on by forces such as gravity, nor forces incurred by
collisions with dynamic objects (think of moving platforms in a
platform game, for example). For such objects simply setting the
density of the fixture to 0 will mean that the physics will assume
that the object is intended to be <i>static</i> and it will not
react at all to anything. However, checking this box will make a
static object <i>kinematic</i> and although it will be unaffected
by collisions and gravity, it can still be moved around or rotated
using the appropriate variables.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><i><b>NOTE:</b> A sensor fixture will fire off the collision
event when the collision <b>first occurs only</b>, meaning you
don't get a stream of collision events as the two bodies continue
to overlap (which is what would traditionally occur). If they stop
overlapping and overlap subsequently there will be another
collision event triggered.</i><br>
